## Session 1 (recon) — measured

### H1 — KILLED
**Statement:** the three loop-hoisted table base pointers in `$s0/$s1/$s3`
arise from loop-invariant motion of inline global references, not from
explicit source-level locals; removing the locals would renumber the pseudos
and change the allocno tiebreak.
**Mechanism:** loop.c `move_movables` hoisting `set (reg) (symbol_ref)` out of
the loop; higher pseudo numbers → later allocno order.
**Probe:** replaced `tbl_11dc`/`idx_1494`/`tbl_125c` with direct
`D_800A11DC[...]` / `D_800A125C[D_800A1494]` / `D_800A125C[D_800A1495]`
references at the use sites; `sandbox --disable all`.
**Result:** score 40 (from 18), **85 build insns vs 91 target**. GCC emits the
`%hi/%lo` pair at each use site inside the loop and hoists nothing — the three
prologue `lui`+`addiu` pairs vanish entirely.
**Verdict: KILLED.** The explicit locals are a structural requirement of any
matching form. Banked: `rejected/inline-globals-kills-hoisted-base-pointers.c`.

### H2 — KILLED
**Statement:** the staged `arg4`/`arg5` locals in the inherited baseline are a
prior session's artefact; the natural original spelling is one call expression
with both table lookups written inline as arguments.
**Mechanism:** `expand_call` argument expansion order.
**Probe:** collapsed the staging block into
`debug_printf(&D_800161C8, D_800F19C0, tbl_11dc[D_800A11D5], tbl_125c[idx_1494[0]], tbl_125c[idx_1494[1]]);`
**Result:** score 23 (from 18); insn count unchanged at 91, so a pure
schedule/RA regression. The named intermediates are what pin the two leading
`lbu` at the head of the block.
**Verdict: KILLED.** Banked: `rejected/single-expression-printf-call.c`.

### H2b — MEASURED NEUTRAL (adopted as the candidate)
**Statement:** target loads `idx_1494[0]` before `idx_1494[1]`; our build does
the reverse because the baseline stages `arg5 = tbl_125c[idx[1]]` first.
Swapping the two staged assignments should fix the `lbu` order.
**Probe:** swapped to `arg4 = tbl_125c[idx_1494[0]]; arg5 = tbl_125c[idx_1494[1]];`
**Result:** score 18 — unchanged. The `lbu` pair now matches target's order,
but the `$a1`/`D_800F19C0` load slides from build idx 48/49 (correct) to 56/57
and the `lw $a3` slides from 61 (correct) to 52. Equal score, strictly closer
positionally on the block head.
**Verdict: adopted as `candidate.c`** — it is the better base for the next
session even though the floor is unchanged.

### H3 — CONFIRMED (mechanism), spelling still open
**Statement:** the 3-way callee-save rotation (cluster A) exists because our
`goto` loop emits no `NOTE_INSN_LOOP_BEG`, so `flow.c` does not loop-depth
weight the in-loop references and `global.c:allocno_compare` ranks the `a0`
param above the two table pointers.
**Mechanism:** `allocno_compare` priority =
`floor_log2(n_refs) * n_refs / live_length`; `flow.c` accumulates `n_refs`
weighted by enclosing `loop_depth`. With no loop note, the 1-use param is not
separated from the 2-use table pointers, so it is allocated first and takes
`$s0`. Target needs it third (`$s2`).
**Probe:** rewrote the loop as `do { ... } while (a0 == 0);` with a shared
`ret` exit variable; re-ran `cc1 -da` and read `;; Register dispositions`.
**Result:** allocation order went `73 72 77 76 75` → `73 77 76 72 109 84 75`
and dispositions went `72 in 16 / 77 in 17 / 76 in 18` →
`77 in 16 / 76 in 17 / 72 in 18`. **Exactly the target permutation.**
Sandbox score of this spelling is 29 (98 insns) because the loop notes also
let `loop.c` hoist the two loop-invariant compare constants (`0x3C0000`,
`0x1000000`) into two extra callee-saves.
**Verdict: CONFIRMED as the mechanism for cluster A.** The remaining work is a
loop spelling that keeps the notes and denies the constant hoisting. Banked
with the full next-probe list:
`rejected/real-loop-confirms-ra-but-hoists-constants.c`.

## Session 2 (structural) — measured

### H4 — KILLED (F3 as posed is obsolete)
**Statement:** reading the per-allocno `n_refs` / `live_length` behind the
priority inversion requires an instrumented `cc1` built into `tmp/gccdbg/`.
**Probe:** checked `tools/gcc-2.7.2/build/cc1` for the pre-existing
`BB2_ALLOC_DEBUG` hook in `global.c` (`strings ... | grep -c ALLOCDBG` → 0, the
shipped binary predates it), then read the `-da` dump set instead.
**Result:** `flow.c:dump_flow_info` ALREADY prints both fields
(`Register N used R times across L insns`) into `system.i.flow` (pre
local_alloc) and `system.i.lreg` (post local_alloc — the values `global_alloc`
sorts on). Feeding the `.lreg` numbers through `allocno_compare`'s formula
reproduced the `.greg` allocation order exactly on all 10 variants measured.
**Verdict: KILLED — no instrumented build needed, ever, for this class of
question.** Harness banked at `tmp/grind/saEft01Init/s2/sweep.py`.

### H5 — KILLED (and it closes off the entire goto-loop branch)
**Statement:** the callee-save rotation can be fixed within the `goto` loop by
statement placement alone (moving the three pointer assignments earlier/later,
reordering them, aliasing the param, restructuring the tail).
**Mechanism:** `local-alloc.c:update_equiv_regs` line 1064 doubles
`reg_live_length` for any pseudo whose set carries a `REG_EQUIV` note. All
three table pointers are `(set (reg) (symbol_ref))` and carry one; the param's
`(set (reg/v 72) (reg:SI 4 a0))` does not. So the pointers are scored on 2×
their raw length and the 1-use param wins on `n_refs/live_length`.
**Probe:** six placement variants (`v0_base`, `v2_ptrs_late`, `v3_ptrs_first`,
`v4_shared_ret`, `v5_invert_tail`, `v6_param_alias`, `v8_ptr_order_rev`) run
through `sweep.py`, reading `.lreg` n_refs/live_length for each.
**Result:** the param's live length is 52 in EVERY variant (55 in one);
placement moves the pointers' raw lengths by at most ±4. Arithmetically,
`P76 > P72` needs `2*raw76 < 1.5*raw72` ⇒ `raw72 > 65`, which exceeds the
function's whole live span. **No goto-loop form can produce target's order.**
**Verdict: KILLED.** Loop notes are structurally required, not optional.

### H6 — CONFIRMED (cluster A closed)
**Statement:** a real loop can emit `NOTE_INSN_LOOP_BEG` (flipping the allocno
priorities to target's) while denying `loop.c` the hoist of the two
loop-invariant compare constants, if BOTH constants are written through ONE
reused scratch local.
**Mechanism:** `loop.c:scan_loop` only builds a movable when
`n_times_set[regno] == 1 || consec_sets_invariant_p(...)`. One local set twice
in the loop, non-consecutively, fails both, so `move_movables` cannot hoist
either constant and both stay materialised inline — which is what target does
(`lui $v0,(0x3C0000>>16)` at target idx 38, `lui $v1,(0x1000000>>16)` at 77).
**Probe:** `do { ... } while (a0 == 0);` with a shared `ret` exit and a single
`s32 k` holding `0x3C0000` then `0x1000000`; `sweep.py` for the dispositions,
`sandbox --disable all` for the score, `grind_diff.py` for the positional diff.
**Result:** dispositions `tbl_125c→$s0, idx_1494→$s1, param→$s2,
tbl_11dc→$s3`, exactly target, using only `$s0-$s3` (`k` gets `$a0`). No
`$s4`/`$s5`. Score 18 at **92** insns (s1's un-reused real loop was 29 at 98).
**Verdict: CONFIRMED. Cluster A is solved.** Banked as `candidate.c`.
Caveat: the reuse is the [[defeat-licm-hoist-var-reuse]] family and has NOT
been cheat-reviewed; do that before any completion claim.

### H7 — KILLED
**Statement:** the remaining tail residual (`bnez / nop / j end / move` where
target has `beqz / move` in the delay slot) is caused by the shared-`ret` +
`break` spelling, and inline `return -1/0/1;` statements — which is what
target's three delay-slot-delivered constants look like — will fix it.
**Probe:** `v11` (`do{...}while(a0==0)` with two inline returns and a trailing
`return 1;`) and `v13` (`for (;;)` with three inline returns), both with the
`k` reuse; `sandbox --disable all`.
**Result:** both 19 at 93 insns — one WORSE than the shared-`ret` candidate,
and the inverted branch + `j end` pair survives unchanged. GCC's choice of
which side of the mask branch falls through is not driven by the exit
spelling. (Same relative ordering as session 1 measured pre-reuse: shared-ret
29/98 beat inline-returns 30/99. Now measured in both regimes.)
**Verdict: KILLED.** Banked: `rejected/inline-returns-instead-of-break-ret.c`.

### H8 — KILLED
**Statement:** reusing the EXISTING `v0` flag local as the constant holder
(instead of a new `k`) will both defeat the hoisting and land the constant in
`$v0`, where target has it.
**Probe:** `v12`, identical to the candidate but with `v0 = 0x3C0000;` /
`v0 = 0x1000000;`; `sandbox --disable all`.
**Result:** 22 at 93. The hoisting is still defeated and the `$s0-$s3` map is
still correct, but overloading the pseudo that also carries the timeout flag
consumed by `if (v0 != 0)` costs more in the flag block than it saves.
**Verdict: KILLED.** The reuse holder must be separate from the exit flag.
Banked: `rejected/v0-as-licm-reuse-holder-regresses.c`.

## Live frontier (for session 3)

### F4 — the tail block layout (+2, the larger half of the residual)
**Mechanism:** GCC emits the mask exit as `bnez v0,<cont> / nop / j <end> /
move v0,zero` because it lays the `ret = 1; while (a0 == 0)` tail block AFTER
the exit jump; target has the un-inverted `beqz $v0,.L80081CFC` falling
straight through into `beqz $s2,.L80081C10`. This is `jump.c` / final block
ordering, not register allocation — the allocation is already correct.
**Next probe:** attack the ORDER, not the exit spelling (H7 killed that):
invert the mask test's source sense so the loop-continue side is the
fall-through (`if (*D_800A14C0 & k) { ret = 1; } else { ret = 0; break; }`);
fold the mask test and the `a0` back-edge condition into one statement
(`if ((*D_800A14C0 & k) == 0) ... ; ` vs `while ((*D_800A14C0 & k) && a0 == 0)`
as the loop condition); and try `continue` for the loop-continue path. Screen
each with `score.py`; the `.lreg`/`sweep.py` predictor does NOT see block
layout, so these need real sandbox runs.

### F5 — the 0x3C0000 holder register (-1, and 2 positional diffs)
**Mechanism:** `k` is allocated `$a0` (nrefs 8, live_length 6), so the
scheduler fills the `bnez v1` delay slot with `lui a0,0x3c` at build idx 31,
where target keeps a `nop` and emits `lui $v0,(0x3C0000>>16)` after the
`D_800F19BC` store. Target's holder is `$v0`, just freed by the preceding
`slt`, and it is therefore not available early enough to be hoisted into the
delay slot.
**Next probe:** the holder cannot simply BE the `v0` local (H8, 22/93). Try
instead: splitting the reuse across two locals that alias different live
ranges but still give each pseudo two sets; moving `k = 0x3C0000;` to sit
between the `D_800F19BC = cnt + 1;` store and the compare (it currently
precedes the store in source but the scheduler moves it anyway); and reading
`.lreg` to see whether `k` can be pushed out of `$a0` by lengthening its live
range slightly.

### F6 — cluster B, now measurable on a correct allocation (inherited F2, unblocked)
**Mechanism:** session 1 could not re-diff the `debug_printf` argument block
because the callee-save map was wrong; it now matches target. The arg-block
address chains index off `$s0` in both builds as of the session-2 candidate.
**Next probe:** re-run `grind_diff.py` on the candidate and re-score both
arg-staging orders (arg4-first and arg5-first) against the corrected
allocation — session 1 measured them equal at 18 under the WRONG allocation,
so that tie must be re-measured before any further arg-block work.

## Superseded frontier (session 1)

### F1 — defeat loop.c's hoisting of the two compare constants
**Mechanism:** `tools/gcc-2.7.2/loop.c` `scan_loop` / `move_movables`. A
`set (reg) (const_int)` becomes a movable and is hoisted to the preheader when
it survives the `maybe_never` test and clears the `threshold` savings test
(`threshold = (loop_has_call ? 1 : 2) * (1 + n_non_fixed_regs)` — this loop
HAS calls, so the bar is low). Target keeps both constants inline.
**Next probe:** read `scan_loop`/`move_movables` for the exact suppression
conditions, then find the C placement/compare spelling that makes each
constant a non-movable — candidates: putting the `0x3C0000` compare where
`maybe_never` is already set, an unsigned-compare spelling that folds the
threshold into the existing `slt` chain, and a bit-test spelling for
`0x1000000` that `combine` keeps inline. Measure each with
`sandbox --disable all` AND with `greg.sh` (the dispositions must stay
`77/76/72 in 16/17/18`).

### F2 — re-diff cluster B on top of a correct cluster-A allocation
**Mechanism:** the arg-block address chains index off `$s0` in target and off
`$s1` in our build, so part of the `$2 <-> $3` / `$2 <-> $4` rename cluster
may be downstream of the callee-save rotation rather than an independent
scheduling problem.
**Next probe:** once any form lands the `77/76/72` dispositions, re-run
`grind_diff.py` and re-score the two known-equal arg-staging orders (H2b and
its inverse) against the new allocation before doing any further arg-block
work.

### F3 — confirm the param's `live_length`/`n_refs` numerically
**Mechanism:** H3 was confirmed end-to-end (loop note → disposition flip) but
the individual `allocno_n_refs` / `allocno_live_length` values were inferred
from the source of `allocno_compare`, not read off. If F1's spellings behave
unexpectedly, the cheapest disambiguation is a `tmp/`-local instrumented cc1
build that prints the two fields per allocno (dumps for understanding only —
the shipped toolchain stays frozen per [[no-compiler-divergence]]).
**Next probe:** build cc1 into `tmp/gccdbg/` with a `fprintf` in
`allocno_compare`'s caller and dump the per-allocno `n_refs`/`live_length` for
both the goto-loop and real-loop forms.

## [s1] The three loop-hoisted table base pointers in $s0/$s1/$s3 arise from loop-invariant motion of inline global references rather than from explicit source-level pointer locals.
- mechanism: loop.c move_movables hoisting set(reg)(symbol_ref) out of the loop; the resulting pseudos would carry higher register numbers and change the allocno tiebreak in global.c.
- probe: Replaced tbl_11dc / idx_1494 / tbl_125c with direct D_800A11DC[...] / D_800A125C[D_800A1494] / D_800A125C[D_800A1495] references at the use sites; sandbox saEft01Init --disable all.
- result: Score 40 (from 18) and 85 build insns against target's 91. GCC emits the %hi/%lo pair at each use site inside the loop and hoists nothing; the three prologue lui+addiu pairs vanish entirely. The explicit locals are a structural requirement of any matching form.
- verdict: KILLED

## [s1] The staged arg4/arg5 locals feeding debug_printf are a prior session's artefact and the natural original spelling is one call expression with both table lookups written inline as arguments.
- mechanism: expand_call argument expansion order for a 5-argument call with one stack-homed argument.
- probe: Collapsed the staging block into debug_printf(&D_800161C8, D_800F19C0, tbl_11dc[D_800A11D5], tbl_125c[idx_1494[0]], tbl_125c[idx_1494[1]]); sandbox --disable all.
- result: Score 23 (from 18) with the instruction count unchanged at 91, i.e. a pure schedule/RA regression. The named intermediates are what pin the two leading lbu at the head of the argument block.
- verdict: KILLED

## [s1] Target loads idx_1494[0] before idx_1494[1]; our build reverses them because the inherited baseline stages arg5 = tbl_125c[idx[1]] first, so swapping the two staged assignments should fix the lbu order.
- mechanism: Statement order of the two named intermediates drives the order in which the two index chains are expanded and hence scheduled.
- probe: Swapped to arg4 = tbl_125c[idx_1494[0]]; arg5 = tbl_125c[idx_1494[1]]; sandbox --disable all plus a positional objdump diff against asm/funcs/saEft01Init.s.
- result: Score 18 — unchanged. The two lbu now match target's order (0x0($s1) then 0x1($s1)), but the $a1/D_800F19C0 load slides from build idx 48/49 (correct) to 56/57 and the lw $a3 slides from 61 (correct) to 52. Equal score, strictly closer positionally at the block head, so adopted as candidate.c.
- verdict: CONFIRMED

## [s1] The 3-way callee-save rotation papered over by regfix.txt ($16<->$18, $16<->$17 plus six stack-offset substs) exists because the function's goto back-edge emits no NOTE_INSN_LOOP_BEG, so flow.c does not loop-depth weight the in-loop references and global.c ranks the a0 param above the two table pointers.
- mechanism: tools/gcc-2.7.2/global.c allocno_compare computes priority = floor_log2(n_refs) * n_refs / live_length, and flow.c accumulates n_refs weighted by the enclosing loop_depth. With no loop note, loop_depth is 1 throughout, the 1-use param (2 refs) is not separated from the 2-use table pointers (3 refs), and the param is allocated first and takes $s0. Target needs it allocated third, in $s2.
- probe: Rewrote the loop as do { ... } while (a0 == 0); with a single shared ret exit variable (matching target's converge-at-.L80081CFC tail), then re-ran cc1 -O2 -G0 -funsigned-char -mcpu=3000 -mips1 -mno-abicalls -fno-builtin -da and read ';; Register dispositions' for the function.
- result: Allocation order went '73 72 77 76 75' -> '73 77 76 72 109 84 75' and dispositions went '72 in 16 / 77 in 17 / 76 in 18' -> '77 in 16 / 76 in 17 / 72 in 18' — exactly target's permutation (tbl_125c->$s0, idx_1494->$s1, param->$s2). The sandbox score of this spelling is 29 at 98 insns because the loop notes also let loop.c hoist the two loop-invariant compare constants 0x3C0000 and 0x1000000 into two extra callee-saves ($s4, $s5), adding allocnos 84 and 109 and displacing tbl_11dc to $s5. Mechanism confirmed; spelling still open.
- verdict: CONFIRMED

## [s2] Reading the per-allocno n_refs / live_length behind the priority inversion requires building an instrumented cc1 into tmp/gccdbg/ (session 1's F3).
- mechanism: allocno_compare's inputs are not printed by the .greg dump; global.c carries a BB2_ALLOC_DEBUG fprintf hook but the shipped tools/gcc-2.7.2/build/cc1 predates it (strings | grep -c ALLOCDBG == 0).
- probe: Checked the shipped cc1 for the ALLOCDBG string, then inspected the rest of the -da dump set for the same data.
- result: flow.c:dump_flow_info ALREADY prints both fields as 'Register N used R times across L insns', into system.i.flow (pre local_alloc) and system.i.lreg (post local_alloc, which is what global_alloc sorts on). Feeding the .lreg numbers through pri = floor_log2(n_refs)*n_refs/live_length*10000, ties by ascending pseudo number, reproduced the .greg ';; N regs to allocate:' order EXACTLY on all 10 variants measured this session. No instrumented build is needed for this class of question, now or ever. Harness banked at tmp/grind/saEft01Init/s2/sweep.py.
- verdict: KILLED

## [s2] The 3-way callee-save rotation can be fixed inside the existing goto-loop by statement placement alone (moving/reordering the three pointer assignments, aliasing the param, restructuring the tail).
- mechanism: local-alloc.c:update_equiv_regs line 1064 doubles reg_live_length for any pseudo whose set carries a REG_EQUIV note. All three table pointers are (set (reg) (symbol_ref "D_800A1xxx")) and carry REG_EQUIV; the param's (set (reg/v 72) (reg:SI 4 a0)) does not. So the pointers are scored on 2x their raw live length and the 1-use param outranks them.
- probe: Seven placement variants (v0_base, v2_ptrs_late, v3_ptrs_first, v4_shared_ret, v5_invert_tail, v6_param_alias, v8_ptr_order_rev) run through sweep.py, reading .lreg n_refs/live_length and the resulting .greg order for each.
- result: The param's live_length is 52 in every variant (55 in one); placement moves the pointers' raw lengths by at most +/-4 (v2_ptrs_late moved them by 0, v3_ptrs_first by +4). Baseline numbers: 72=2refs/52, 77=3/96, 76=3/98, 75=2/100. P76 > P72 requires 2*raw76 < 1.5*raw72, i.e. raw72 > 65, which exceeds the function's whole live span (~52). No goto-loop form can produce target's allocation order; the loop notes are structurally required, not one option among several.
- verdict: KILLED

## [s2] A real loop can emit NOTE_INSN_LOOP_BEG (flipping the allocno priorities to target's) while denying loop.c the hoist of the two loop-invariant compare constants 0x3C0000 and 0x1000000, if both constants are written through ONE reused scratch local.
- mechanism: loop.c:scan_loop only builds a movable when n_times_set[regno] == 1 || consec_sets_invariant_p(...). One local set twice in the loop, non-consecutively, fails both disjuncts, so move_movables cannot hoist either constant and both stay materialised inline inside the loop — which is exactly what target does (lui $v0,(0x3C0000>>16) at target idx 38, lui $v1,(0x1000000>>16) at idx 77).
- probe: do { ... } while (a0 == 0); with a shared ret exit and a single s32 k assigned 0x3C0000 at the timeout compare and 0x1000000 at the mask test; sweep.py for the dispositions, sandbox saEft01Init --disable all for the score, tmp/grind/saEft01Init/s1/grind_diff.py for the positional diff.
- result: Dispositions tbl_125c->$s0, idx_1494->$s1, param->$s2, tbl_11dc->$s3 — exactly target's map — using only $s0-$s3, with k allocated the caller-saved $a0. No $s4/$s5, both constants materialised inline. Score 18 at 92 build insns vs 91 target (session 1's un-reused real loop was 29 at 98). Cluster A, i.e. the whole regfix.txt:97-103 + 115-119 rename block, is solved in pure C. Banked as memory/grind/saEft01Init/candidate.c.
- verdict: CONFIRMED

## [s2] The remaining tail residual (bnez / nop / j end / move, where target has beqz with the constant in the delay slot) is caused by the shared-ret + break spelling, and inline return -1/0/1 statements will fix it.
- mechanism: Target's tail delivers each return constant in a branch delay slot (addiu $v0,-1; addu $v0,$zero,$zero; addiu $v0,0x1), which reads as three inline returns rather than a shared ret variable.
- probe: v11 (do{...}while(a0==0) with two inline returns and a trailing return 1) and v13 (for(;;) with three inline returns), both keeping the k reuse; sandbox --disable all.
- result: Both 19 at 93 insns — one worse than the shared-ret candidate — and the inverted branch plus j end pair survives unchanged. GCC's choice of which side of the mask branch falls through is not driven by the exit spelling. Consistent with session 1's pre-reuse measurement (shared-ret 29/98 beat inline-returns 30/99); the shared-ret shape is now measured better in both regimes.
- verdict: KILLED

## [s2] Reusing the EXISTING v0 flag local as the constant holder instead of introducing a new k will both defeat the hoisting and land the constant in $v0, where target holds it.
- mechanism: Target materialises 0x3C0000 into $v0, which the preceding slt has just freed; our k gets $a0, so the scheduler fills the bnez delay slot with lui a0,0x3c where target keeps a nop.
- probe: v12, identical to the candidate but with v0 = 0x3C0000; and v0 = 0x1000000; sandbox --disable all.
- result: 22 at 93 insns. The hoisting is still defeated and the $s0-$s3 map stays correct, but overloading the pseudo that also carries the timeout/success flag consumed by if (v0 != 0) costs more in the flag block than it saves at the compare. The reuse holder must be a local separate from the exit flag.
- verdict: KILLED
