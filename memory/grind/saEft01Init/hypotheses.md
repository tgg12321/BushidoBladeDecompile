# Hypothesis ledger — saEft01Init

## Session 1 (recon) — measured

### H1 — KILLED
**Statement:** the three loop-hoisted table base pointers in `$s0/$s1/$s3`
arise from loop-invariant motion of inline global references, not from
explicit source-level locals; removing the locals would renumber the pseudos
and change the allocno tiebreak.
**Mechanism:** loop.c `move_movables` hoisting `set (reg) (symbol_ref)` out of
the loop; higher pseudo numbers → later allocno order.
**Probe:** replaced `tbl_11dc`/`idx_1494`/`tbl_125c` with direct
`D_800A11DC[...]` / `D_800A125C[D_800A1494]` / `D_800A125C[D_800A1495]`
references at the use sites; `sandbox --disable all`.
**Result:** score 40 (from 18), **85 build insns vs 91 target**. GCC emits the
`%hi/%lo` pair at each use site inside the loop and hoists nothing — the three
prologue `lui`+`addiu` pairs vanish entirely.
**Verdict: KILLED.** The explicit locals are a structural requirement of any
matching form. Banked: `rejected/inline-globals-kills-hoisted-base-pointers.c`.

### H2 — KILLED
**Statement:** the staged `arg4`/`arg5` locals in the inherited baseline are a
prior session's artefact; the natural original spelling is one call expression
with both table lookups written inline as arguments.
**Mechanism:** `expand_call` argument expansion order.
**Probe:** collapsed the staging block into
`debug_printf(&D_800161C8, D_800F19C0, tbl_11dc[D_800A11D5], tbl_125c[idx_1494[0]], tbl_125c[idx_1494[1]]);`
**Result:** score 23 (from 18); insn count unchanged at 91, so a pure
schedule/RA regression. The named intermediates are what pin the two leading
`lbu` at the head of the block.
**Verdict: KILLED.** Banked: `rejected/single-expression-printf-call.c`.

### H2b — MEASURED NEUTRAL (adopted as the candidate)
**Statement:** target loads `idx_1494[0]` before `idx_1494[1]`; our build does
the reverse because the baseline stages `arg5 = tbl_125c[idx[1]]` first.
Swapping the two staged assignments should fix the `lbu` order.
**Probe:** swapped to `arg4 = tbl_125c[idx_1494[0]]; arg5 = tbl_125c[idx_1494[1]];`
**Result:** score 18 — unchanged. The `lbu` pair now matches target's order,
but the `$a1`/`D_800F19C0` load slides from build idx 48/49 (correct) to 56/57
and the `lw $a3` slides from 61 (correct) to 52. Equal score, strictly closer
positionally on the block head.
**Verdict: adopted as `candidate.c`** — it is the better base for the next
session even though the floor is unchanged.

### H3 — CONFIRMED (mechanism), spelling still open
**Statement:** the 3-way callee-save rotation (cluster A) exists because our
`goto` loop emits no `NOTE_INSN_LOOP_BEG`, so `flow.c` does not loop-depth
weight the in-loop references and `global.c:allocno_compare` ranks the `a0`
param above the two table pointers.
**Mechanism:** `allocno_compare` priority =
`floor_log2(n_refs) * n_refs / live_length`; `flow.c` accumulates `n_refs`
weighted by enclosing `loop_depth`. With no loop note, the 1-use param is not
separated from the 2-use table pointers, so it is allocated first and takes
`$s0`. Target needs it third (`$s2`).
**Probe:** rewrote the loop as `do { ... } while (a0 == 0);` with a shared
`ret` exit variable; re-ran `cc1 -da` and read `;; Register dispositions`.
**Result:** allocation order went `73 72 77 76 75` → `73 77 76 72 109 84 75`
and dispositions went `72 in 16 / 77 in 17 / 76 in 18` →
`77 in 16 / 76 in 17 / 72 in 18`. **Exactly the target permutation.**
Sandbox score of this spelling is 29 (98 insns) because the loop notes also
let `loop.c` hoist the two loop-invariant compare constants (`0x3C0000`,
`0x1000000`) into two extra callee-saves.
**Verdict: CONFIRMED as the mechanism for cluster A.** The remaining work is a
loop spelling that keeps the notes and denies the constant hoisting. Banked
with the full next-probe list:
`rejected/real-loop-confirms-ra-but-hoists-constants.c`.

## Live frontier (for session 2)

### F1 — defeat loop.c's hoisting of the two compare constants
**Mechanism:** `tools/gcc-2.7.2/loop.c` `scan_loop` / `move_movables`. A
`set (reg) (const_int)` becomes a movable and is hoisted to the preheader when
it survives the `maybe_never` test and clears the `threshold` savings test
(`threshold = (loop_has_call ? 1 : 2) * (1 + n_non_fixed_regs)` — this loop
HAS calls, so the bar is low). Target keeps both constants inline.
**Next probe:** read `scan_loop`/`move_movables` for the exact suppression
conditions, then find the C placement/compare spelling that makes each
constant a non-movable — candidates: putting the `0x3C0000` compare where
`maybe_never` is already set, an unsigned-compare spelling that folds the
threshold into the existing `slt` chain, and a bit-test spelling for
`0x1000000` that `combine` keeps inline. Measure each with
`sandbox --disable all` AND with `greg.sh` (the dispositions must stay
`77/76/72 in 16/17/18`).

### F2 — re-diff cluster B on top of a correct cluster-A allocation
**Mechanism:** the arg-block address chains index off `$s0` in target and off
`$s1` in our build, so part of the `$2 <-> $3` / `$2 <-> $4` rename cluster
may be downstream of the callee-save rotation rather than an independent
scheduling problem.
**Next probe:** once any form lands the `77/76/72` dispositions, re-run
`grind_diff.py` and re-score the two known-equal arg-staging orders (H2b and
its inverse) against the new allocation before doing any further arg-block
work.

### F3 — confirm the param's `live_length`/`n_refs` numerically
**Mechanism:** H3 was confirmed end-to-end (loop note → disposition flip) but
the individual `allocno_n_refs` / `allocno_live_length` values were inferred
from the source of `allocno_compare`, not read off. If F1's spellings behave
unexpectedly, the cheapest disambiguation is a `tmp/`-local instrumented cc1
build that prints the two fields per allocno (dumps for understanding only —
the shipped toolchain stays frozen per [[no-compiler-divergence]]).
**Next probe:** build cc1 into `tmp/gccdbg/` with a `fprintf` in
`allocno_compare`'s caller and dump the per-allocno `n_refs`/`live_length` for
both the goto-loop and real-loop forms.

## [s1] The three loop-hoisted table base pointers in $s0/$s1/$s3 arise from loop-invariant motion of inline global references rather than from explicit source-level pointer locals.
- mechanism: loop.c move_movables hoisting set(reg)(symbol_ref) out of the loop; the resulting pseudos would carry higher register numbers and change the allocno tiebreak in global.c.
- probe: Replaced tbl_11dc / idx_1494 / tbl_125c with direct D_800A11DC[...] / D_800A125C[D_800A1494] / D_800A125C[D_800A1495] references at the use sites; sandbox saEft01Init --disable all.
- result: Score 40 (from 18) and 85 build insns against target's 91. GCC emits the %hi/%lo pair at each use site inside the loop and hoists nothing; the three prologue lui+addiu pairs vanish entirely. The explicit locals are a structural requirement of any matching form.
- verdict: KILLED

## [s1] The staged arg4/arg5 locals feeding debug_printf are a prior session's artefact and the natural original spelling is one call expression with both table lookups written inline as arguments.
- mechanism: expand_call argument expansion order for a 5-argument call with one stack-homed argument.
- probe: Collapsed the staging block into debug_printf(&D_800161C8, D_800F19C0, tbl_11dc[D_800A11D5], tbl_125c[idx_1494[0]], tbl_125c[idx_1494[1]]); sandbox --disable all.
- result: Score 23 (from 18) with the instruction count unchanged at 91, i.e. a pure schedule/RA regression. The named intermediates are what pin the two leading lbu at the head of the argument block.
- verdict: KILLED

## [s1] Target loads idx_1494[0] before idx_1494[1]; our build reverses them because the inherited baseline stages arg5 = tbl_125c[idx[1]] first, so swapping the two staged assignments should fix the lbu order.
- mechanism: Statement order of the two named intermediates drives the order in which the two index chains are expanded and hence scheduled.
- probe: Swapped to arg4 = tbl_125c[idx_1494[0]]; arg5 = tbl_125c[idx_1494[1]]; sandbox --disable all plus a positional objdump diff against asm/funcs/saEft01Init.s.
- result: Score 18 — unchanged. The two lbu now match target's order (0x0($s1) then 0x1($s1)), but the $a1/D_800F19C0 load slides from build idx 48/49 (correct) to 56/57 and the lw $a3 slides from 61 (correct) to 52. Equal score, strictly closer positionally at the block head, so adopted as candidate.c.
- verdict: CONFIRMED

## [s1] The 3-way callee-save rotation papered over by regfix.txt ($16<->$18, $16<->$17 plus six stack-offset substs) exists because the function's goto back-edge emits no NOTE_INSN_LOOP_BEG, so flow.c does not loop-depth weight the in-loop references and global.c ranks the a0 param above the two table pointers.
- mechanism: tools/gcc-2.7.2/global.c allocno_compare computes priority = floor_log2(n_refs) * n_refs / live_length, and flow.c accumulates n_refs weighted by the enclosing loop_depth. With no loop note, loop_depth is 1 throughout, the 1-use param (2 refs) is not separated from the 2-use table pointers (3 refs), and the param is allocated first and takes $s0. Target needs it allocated third, in $s2.
- probe: Rewrote the loop as do { ... } while (a0 == 0); with a single shared ret exit variable (matching target's converge-at-.L80081CFC tail), then re-ran cc1 -O2 -G0 -funsigned-char -mcpu=3000 -mips1 -mno-abicalls -fno-builtin -da and read ';; Register dispositions' for the function.
- result: Allocation order went '73 72 77 76 75' -> '73 77 76 72 109 84 75' and dispositions went '72 in 16 / 77 in 17 / 76 in 18' -> '77 in 16 / 76 in 17 / 72 in 18' — exactly target's permutation (tbl_125c->$s0, idx_1494->$s1, param->$s2). The sandbox score of this spelling is 29 at 98 insns because the loop notes also let loop.c hoist the two loop-invariant compare constants 0x3C0000 and 0x1000000 into two extra callee-saves ($s4, $s5), adding allocnos 84 and 109 and displacing tbl_11dc to $s5. Mechanism confirmed; spelling still open.
- verdict: CONFIRMED
