# Evidence bank — func_80049A2C

## Baseline (session s1, 2026-07-20)
- Current src/text1b.c form: `sandbox --disable all` = **0** (score 0, 126/126 insns).
- Canonical verdict: **C** (pure-C distance 0).
- Target frame: `addiu $sp,-0x30` (48). Callee-saves s0,s1,s2,s3,ra at 0x18..0x28.
  Below 0x18: 24 bytes = 16 outgoing-arg area + 8 bytes locals padding.
  Frame equation (mips.c:compute_frame_size): 48 = ALIGN8(vars) + ALIGN8(args=16) + ALIGN8(gp_regs=20)
  → vars ∈ [1..8]. Target has 1–8 bytes of `get_frame_size()` locals.

## The four judge-flagged constructs — MEASURED contribution (isolated deletion, each with the other three still in place)
| Construct | Score after removing ONLY this | Load-bearing? |
|---|---|---|
| `s32 dummy[2];` + `(void) dummy;` | **12** | **YES** (frame slot for ALIGN8(vars)) |
| `char new_var4;` + `(void) new_var4;` | 0 | NO — pure noise |
| `if (a1_val) { }` | 0 | NO — pure noise (empty stmt DCE'd) |
| `(new_var = new_var3)` inline-assign + `int new_var;` | 0 | NO — pure noise |

**Combined:** removing all four noise-constructs together (keeping dummy) → 0.
Removing all four INCLUDING dummy → 12. Therefore dummy[2] is the SOLE
load-bearing cheat; three of the four judge-flagged items can just be deleted.

## Cross-reference
- phantom-frame-slots-gcc272 (memory/project/) — GCC 2.7.2 reserves locals bytes
  for LIVE locals it register-allocates away. The +8 target-frame slot is
  reachable in pure C via a live-then-DCE'd local (memory's minimal trigger:
  HImode local feeding HImode bitwise expression).
- dead-vars-local-array (.claude/rules/) — the 2026-07-01 SOTN carve-out for
  written-never-read arrays does NOT apply here: target has ZERO `sw ...,0x0-0x14($sp)`
  stores (only the 5 register saves), so no oracle-backed dead-store evidence.

## Session artifacts
- tmp/grind/func_80049A2C/s1/text1b.baseline.c — pre-session src snapshot.

- [s1] Baseline (on-disk src/text1b.c form): sandbox --disable all = 0, canonical verdict C (pure-C distance 0).

- [s1] Target func_80049A2C.s frame prologue: addiu $sp,-0x30; saves s0/s1/s2/s3/ra at 0x18/0x1C/0x20/0x24/0x28. Locals area = 0x00..0x17 = 24 bytes = 16 outgoing-arg + 8 unused padding.

- [s1] Frame equation (mips.c compute_frame_size, ALIGN8): 48 = ALIGN8(vars) + ALIGN8(16 args) + ALIGN8(20 gp_regs=5*4) → ALIGN8(vars)=8 → vars in [1..8].

- [s1] phantom-frame-slots-gcc272 (memory/project/) says GCC 2.7.2 reserves get_frame_size() for LIVE locals it RA's away; minimal trigger HImode bitwise. Provides a legitimate route to the +8 slot without any dead-declaration cheat.

- [s1] dead-vars-local-array 2026-07-01 SOTN carve-out does NOT apply: target has ZERO sw ...,0x0-0x14($sp) stores; the carve-out requires oracle-backed dead-store evidence.

- [s1] Noise-construct killings mean next session can safely drop the three cheats and focus its entire budget on the phantom-frame lever for dummy[2].
