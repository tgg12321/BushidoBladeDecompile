# Hypothesis ledger — func_800283D0

## Session 1 (2026-08-19, recon) — measured

| id | hypothesis | mechanism | probe | result | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| H1 | s32 raw holder (872C sibling spelling) makes the & 0xFFFF reach RTL and survive as andi while the load stays lhu | tree-level fold-const only folds by declared type; combine won't substitute a multi-use AND | `u16 temp_a1` -> `s32 temp_a1`, sandbox + objdump | andi v1,raw,0xffff emitted, lhu kept; 44 flat (a1/a2 swap remained) | CONFIRMED |
| H2 | li-4 vs lhu hard-reg swap is global.c allocno_compare priority: const wins by live length 14 vs 15; equalizing lengths flips via ascending-allocno tiebreak | global.c:635-655 (pri = floor_log2(refs)*refs*10000/length; tie -> lower allocno) | moved `var_s1 = 0;` after the range-check if (dead on the return path) | 44 -> 39; slots 6/12/14/27 all match | CONFIRMED |
| H2b | source statement order of the loads changes lreg live length | (refuted) sched1 re-hoists loads and live lengths are recomputed post-sched1 | moved the lhu statement after ret=1 | no change | KILLED |
| H3 | range-check exit is an inline `return 1;` (mixed exit forms), not the shared block_13 | jump2 cross-jump vs distinct exit tails | `goto block_13` -> `return 1;` | 39 -> 37 | CONFIRMED |
| H4 | target recomputes temp_a1_2*2 in-arm; the named local caused the hoist | cse does not extend across the branch when the expression is written per-arm | delete `temp_v0_2`, inline `(temp_a1_2 * 2)` at both uses | 37 -> 30 (also fixed the bne/slt operand diffs downstream) | CONFIRMED |

## Frontier (for session 2)

1. **Tail a0/a1 swap (~6 diffs)** — same shape as the SOLVED a1/a2 swap. Probe: regenerate
   dumps at floor 30, find the two pseudos (the `sll s5,0x4`/addu pointer vs the Judge-table
   `lh` value), compute allocno_compare priorities, look for a semantics-clean statement
   placement that equalizes/flips live lengths (the H2 recipe). Mechanism: global.c
   allocno_compare (global.c:635-655).
2. **Diamond 2 (+4 insns): defeat the cross-jump merge of the second var_v0_2 selection copy**
   (C ~585-599). Read .claude/rules/cross-jump-store-tail-merge.md FIRST (coupled-fixpoint
   warning). Candidate spellings: duplicate the real store+goto differently per arm / invert
   the || range-check so the D_800A38A8 block is the fallthrough (target's beqz sense);
   the v0/v1 rename on the 1/-1 stores (3 diffs) should follow as downstream. Mechanism:
   jump2 find_cross_jump.
3. **s2/s3 prologue rotation (~12 diffs)** — the known-hard arg-home wall (shared with
   func_8008C1E8, brief-shared §5). Do NOT open frontally, BUT: the addu operand-order clue
   (target `addu s3,v0,s0` = X + arg0, ours `addu s2,s0,v0` = arg0 + X at the temp_s3 site)
   is a cheap commutativity respelling probe worth ONE measurement before treating the whole
   cluster as the prologue wall — the rotation may be partly downstream of that spelling.

## [s1] An s32 holder for the raw *(u16*) load (the func_8002872C sibling spelling) makes the & 0xFFFF mask reach RTL and survive as a real andi while the load stays lhu
- mechanism: The old u16 holder let front-end fold-const delete the mask before RTL existed (grep 65535 in .rtl: absent) - the prior sessions' combine/nonzero_bits framing was moot, and P0's u32 conclusion does not generalize. With s32, the multi-use AND survives combine (same-TU sibling func_8002872C proves it in the .combine dump).
- probe: u16 temp_a1 -> s32 temp_a1; sandbox + objdump of the sandbox .o
- result: lhu + andi v1,raw,0xffff emitted matching target's shape; score flat 44 because the a1/a2 hard-reg swap remained
- verdict: CONFIRMED

## [s1] The li-4 vs lhu a1/a2 swap is a global.c allocno_compare priority margin of exactly one insn of live length, and equalizing the lengths flips it via the ascending-allocno tiebreak
- mechanism: global.c:635-655: pri = floor_log2(refs)*refs*10000*size/live_length; pseudo 74 (raw, 3 refs/15) lost to pseudo 81 (const 4, 3 refs/14); tie goes to the lower allocno (74). The var_s1=0 store was the one insn inside 74's range but outside 81's, and block_13 (return) never reads var_s1, so moving the store below the range-check if is semantics-clean.
- probe: Move var_s1 = 0; after the range-check if; sandbox + pairdiff
- result: 44 -> 39; li a2,4 / lhu a1 / andi v1,a1 / addiu v0,a1,-25 all match target
- verdict: CONFIRMED

## [s1] Source statement order of the loads changes lreg live length
- mechanism: sched1 re-hoists loads and reg_live_length is recomputed post-sched1, so load statement order is laundered
- probe: Moved the lhu statement after ret=1
- result: No change in registers or score
- verdict: KILLED

## [s1] The rejection-chain exit is an inline return 1 (mixed exit forms), not the shared block_13 return
- mechanism: jump2 cross-jump merges identical exit tails; a distinct inline return produces target's j + li v0,1 tail. ret is the constant 1 so return 1; is semantics-identical ordinary C (SOTN-sanctioned mixed exit forms).
- probe: goto block_13 -> return 1; at the range-check exit
- result: 39 -> 37, diamond-1 closed
- verdict: CONFIRMED

## [s1] Target recomputes temp_a1_2*2 inside the arm; the named local temp_v0_2 caused our hoisted sll + copy
- mechanism: With the expression written per-use, cse does not extend it across the branch; the named single-def local forced one early sll plus a carrier copy
- probe: Delete s32 temp_v0_2, inline (temp_a1_2 * 2) at both use sites
- result: 37 -> 30; also resolved the bne/slt operand-order diffs downstream
- verdict: CONFIRMED
