# Hypothesis ledger — func_80062020

## Honest floor: 10 (sandbox --disable all). Was stale-ledgered as 12 (pin-aided) / 20 (naive pure-C).

The stale "12" was measured with the abandoned pinned src still in place —
register-asm pins are NOT stripped by the sandbox, so 12 was a cheat-aided
score. Naive pure-C (walking a0[K] source, no pins) = 20. The s1 lever below = 10.

## s1 findings (recon)

- **H-loop [CONFIRMED lever, loop now 100% match].** Reading source via the
  FIXED-base indexed form `*(s32*)((u8*)arg0 + ofs + K)` (K=0/4/8) instead of a
  walking `a0[K]` pointer lets GCC strength-reduce source into ONE walking giv
  (`0/4/8(a0); a0+=12`) while `ofs` stays the dest-index biv (v1). The walking
  `a0[K]` form makes GCC build TWO induction pointers (`move a1,a0`+`addiu a0,a0,8`),
  = floor 20. Indexed form = floor 10, entire loop region matches target.

- **H-epilogue-split [root-caused, plateau at 10].** All 10 residual diffs are
  the 3-store terminator epilogue. Target: index `12*count` in v1, base
  `&D_800F1198` in v0, `v0=index+base`, cols c/b via `8(v0)`/`4(v0)`, col a via
  a SEPARATE `lui at,%hi(1198); addu at,at,v1; sw %lo(1198)(at)` (split, keeps
  index v1 live). This PARTIAL CSE (base pointer for 2 cols + %hi/%lo recompute
  for 1 col) is produced by NO uniform pure-C spelling:
    * pointer p[0..2] / flat array  -> full CSE  (0/4/8(v0)), 7-insn epilogue
    * consistent `&sym+i12+K` / 3 distinct symbols -> full recompute, 9-insn
  Only the dual-expression (col a via symbol+index, cols b,c via pointer p)
  reproduces target's split — and that is the rejected [[inline-asm-injection]]-
  adjacent dual-spelling (same row, two spellings, no semantic purpose), which
  ALSO still fails to close (score 12: reg-alloc puts index in v0 not v1, order off).

- **Coupling.** The register placement (index->v1) and the split are the SAME
  phenomenon: target double-uses the raw index, so it (a) stays live -> v1, and
  (b) needs col a spelled apart from cols b,c. The 4 pins in the abandoned src
  forced the v1 placement; without them GCC picks v0.

## Open frontier (for next session)
See outcome frontier. The live question: is there a pure-C / semantic-object-model
form (col a = flag, cols b,c = data) that produces the double-index-use WITHOUT
being a same-lvalue respelling? If not, floor 10 is a genuine addressing-mode
plateau -> escalation candidate.

## [s1] Reading source via fixed-base indexed form *(s32*)((u8*)arg0+ofs+K) instead of walking a0[K] makes GCC emit a single walking source induction pointer (0/4/8(a0),a0+=12) matching target, dropping the floor from 20 to 10.
- mechanism: GCC 2.7.2 loop strength-reduction: arg0+ofs+K reduces to one giv walking by 12 with K as the load displacement, while ofs stays the dest-index biv (v1). The walking a0[K] form instead spawns two induction pointers (move a1,a0 + addiu a0,a0,8).
- probe: Edited src to indexed-source loop, sandbox --disable all, objdump-compared loop region to asm/funcs/func_80062020.s.
- result: Loop region (25 insns) matches target byte-for-byte; sandbox 20->10.
- verdict: CONFIRMED

## [s1] No uniform pure-C epilogue spelling reproduces target's partial-CSE addressing (base pointer 4/8(v0) for cols b,c + separate %hi/%lo(D_800F1198)+index for col a); every uniform form gives full-CSE (all 0/4/8(v0)) or full-recompute (all %hi/%lo).
- mechanism: Target double-uses the raw index 12*count (once to form base+index pointer v0, once for col a's %hi+index), keeping it live in v1. A uniform spelling either CSEs the base for all 3 cols or recomputes for all 3; the mixed result requires col a to be spelled apart from cols b,c.
- probe: Measured 5 epilogue spellings: pointer p[0..2], flat s32-array row*3+col, consistent &sym+i12+K, three distinct symbols, col0-first dual-expression. Disassembled each.
- result: pointer/flat = full CSE 7-insn (score 10-11); consistent/distinct = full recompute 9-insn (score 10); dual-expression = target's split structure but score 12 (index in v0 not v1, order off).
- verdict: CONFIRMED

## [s1] The prior-ledger floor 12 was cheat-aided, not the honest pure-C floor.
- mechanism: The abandoned src carried 4 register-asm pins ($4/$5/$3/$2). The sandbox strips __asm__ blocks but NOT register asm("$N") declarations, so those pins steered register allocation into the 12-diff score. Removing them (naive walking form) = 20; the indexed lever = 10.
- probe: Removed pins, re-measured; compared cheat_asm_stripped counts (354 pinned vs 346 pure-C) and build_insns (41 pinned vs 38 pure).
- result: Pure-C honest floor established at 10.
- verdict: CONFIRMED
