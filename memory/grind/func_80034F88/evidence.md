# evidence — func_80034F88 (src/code6cac_b.c)

## Routing / size
- `canonical func_80034F88` → verdict **C**, `asm_insns: 0`, `total: 49`,
  reason "pure-C distance 24 <= 50 — pure-C target". Not an asm-routing case;
  this is an ordinary pure-C grind.
- Target is 49 instructions. It is a small, fully-understood function — there
  is no unknown semantics here, only a codegen-spelling problem.

## What the function does (settled — no further reverse-engineering needed)
```
p = func_80077D00();            /* returns a struct pointer; only p[8] (=0x20) is read */
D_80106A73 &= 0xF8;             /* clear the low three bits of the flag byte */
flagbyte |= 1 if (p[8] & 1);    /* three times, bits 1, 2, 4 — each written as a  */
flagbyte |= 2 if (p[8] & 2);    /*   CONDITIONAL VALUE followed by an UNCONDITIONAL */
flagbyte |= 4 if (p[8] & 4);    /*   store, not as a conditional store */
for (i = 0; i < 3; i++)         /* copy 3 bytes from p+0x17 to D_80106A70[i] */
    (&D_80106A70)[i] = ((u8 *)p)[0x17 + i];
```
The "conditional value, unconditional store" reading is forced by the target
bytes: each block is `bnez v0,.L; ori v0,<val>,K (delay); addu v0,<val>,zero;
.L: sb v0,0(<base>)` — the store is on the join, and the `ori` sits in the
delay slot so it executes on both paths. A plain `if (c) G |= K;` would put
the `sb` inside the taken arm; it does not.

The final 3-byte copy loop already matches target's shape exactly in every
form measured (`addu v0,a1,v1` before the loop and again in the branch delay
slot, `lbu v0,0x17(v0)`, `lui at,%hi; addu at,at,v1; sb v0,%lo(...)($at)`).
**No work is needed on the loop** — every remaining point of distance is in
the three flag blocks and the `&= 0xF8`.

## Floor history (this session, all via `sandbox func_80034F88 --disable all`)
| form | score | build insns |
|---|---|---|
| committed baseline (pointer everywhere + 3 `asm volatile("":::"memory")` barriers) | 24 | 48 |
| **`*ptr &= 0xF8` + symbol reads + symbol stores  ← best, now in src/** | **23** | 50 |
| `*ptr &= 0xF8` + symbol reads + `*ptr` stores | 24 | 51 |
| symbol reads via `*ptr`, all stores via symbol | 27 | 52 |
| symbol only, `s32` temps | 28 | 47 |
| symbol only, `u8` temps (the "clean" spelling) | 29 | 48 |
| symbol only + `extern volatile u8 D_80106A73;` | 29 | 48 |

The three `asm volatile("" ::: "memory")` scheduling barriers that the
committed baseline carried are **removed** in the current source. They are a
forbidden family (scheduling barriers) and were score-inert anyway — the
sandbox strips them (`cheat_asm_stripped` dropped 320 → 317 when they went).

## The mechanism that produced the 24 → 23 drop (CONFIRMED)
GCC 2.7.2's `cse.c` forwards a QImode store into a following load of the same
byte **only when the two accesses hash to the same address rtx**. Writing the
byte through the pointer local `ptr` and reading it back through the plain
symbol `D_80106A73` gives two different address expressions, so the read is
not satisfied from the stored value and survives as a real `lbu` — which is
what the target does. Objdump proof (variant B, `tmp/grind/func_80034F88/s1/
variantB_score23.txt`): `sb a0,0(v1)` followed by `lui a0; lbu a0,0(a0)`.
Applying the same mismatch to all three blocks (the score-24 rejected form)
produces all three reloads.

## The two residual defects, precisely (this is the whole remaining gap)
Compare a target flag block against the best-known build:

```
TARGET                                  BUILD (any form measured so far)
  lui  a0,%hi(D_80106A73)                 lui  a0,%hi(D_80106A73)
  addiu a0,a0,%lo(D_80106A73)             lbu  a0,%lo(D_80106A73)(a0)   <- %lo folded in
  lw   v0,0x20(a1)                        lw   v0,0x20(a1)
  lbu  v1,0x0(a0)      <- fills delay      nop                          <- unfilled delay
  andi v0,v0,2                            andi v0,v0,2
  bnez v0,.L                              bnez v0,.L
   ori v0,v1,2                             ori  v1,a0,2
  addu v0,v1,zero                         move v1,a0
.L:                                     .L:
  sb   v0,0x0(a0)      <- SAME base        lui  at,%hi(...)  +  sb ...  <- own address
```

1. **Address form.** Target keeps an *unfolded* `lui`+`addiu` base register
   and uses it for BOTH the block's load and the block's store (`0(a0)`
   twice). Our builds only get the unfolded form when the pointer local has
   ≥2 uses; whenever a given address expression feeds exactly one memory
   operand, `combine` folds `%lo` into that operand and the base disappears.
2. **Delay slot.** Because our reload's address is produced by a `lui`
   immediately before it, the scheduler must emit the reload *ahead* of
   `lw v0,0x20(a1)`, leaving a `nop` in the lw's load-delay slot. Target's
   base is already live, so the reload sinks into the delay slot.

Both defects have the same root: target shares one base register between a
load and a store of the same byte, while our fork forwards the store into the
load exactly when they share an address expression. **Getting the reloads and
getting the shared base are, under every C spelling measured this session,
mutually exclusive.** That tension is the entire frontier.

## Killed axes (do not re-run)
- **`volatile` on D_80106A73 is unmeasurable and therefore dead.** The
  cheat-invisible sandbox *strips the `volatile` qualifier* from the source
  snapshot before compiling — verified by grepping
  `tmp/sandbox/func_80034F88/src/code6cac_b.c:127`, which reads
  `extern u8 D_80106A73;` even though src/ said `extern volatile u8`. So a
  volatile spelling can never move the honest floor, quite apart from being a
  gated coercion family for a game-state global. Axis closed.
- **Integer vs byte typing of the temporaries is not the lever** — s32 temps
  do not defeat the store-to-load forward (score 28, still one `lbu` total).
- **Dropping the pointer local entirely is strictly worse** (29): with one
  memory operand per address expression, combine folds `%lo` everywhere and
  the build loses both the shared base *and* every reload.

## Notes for whoever picks this up
- The current src/ form is the 23-point one, but its `ptr` local has exactly
  ONE use (`*ptr &= 0xF8;`). That is the "why is this here?" smell from the
  cheat checklist — a one-use pointer alias to a global whose only effect is
  on GCC's CSE table. It is checked in because it is the best MEASURED floor,
  not because it is submittable. Do not send it to a Judge as-is.
- `src/code6cac_b.c:4044` already spells `src1 = (&D_80106A73) - 3;`, i.e.
  the codebase treats 0x80106A70..0x80106A73 as one contiguous 4-byte region.
  A struct/array re-derivation of that region is an untried modality, but note
  the target's flag-byte accesses use `%hi/%lo(D_80106A73)` with a 0 offset
  while the copy loop uses `%lo(D_80106A70)($at)` — so if it IS one object,
  the compiler still addressed the two halves independently.

- [s1] canonical verdict C, 0 asm insns, target 49 insns - ordinary pure-C grind, no asm-routing question.

- [s1] Semantics are fully settled: p = func_80077D00(); D_80106A73 &= 0xF8; then three blocks that compute a CONDITIONAL VALUE (bit 1/2/4 from p[8]) and store it UNCONDITIONALLY; then a 3-byte copy loop from p+0x17 into D_80106A70[0..2]. The unconditional-store reading is forced by the target bytes (the ori sits in the branch delay slot and the sb is on the join), so a plain 'if (c) G |= K;' spelling is ruled out.

- [s1] The final 3-byte copy loop already matches target's shape exactly in every form measured - all remaining distance is in the '&= 0xF8' and the three flag blocks.

- [s1] The committed baseline carried three 'asm volatile("" ::: "memory")' scheduling barriers (a forbidden family). They are removed in the current src/; they were score-inert (cheat_asm_stripped fell 320 -> 317 when removed) and the floor improved anyway.

- [s1] Measured floor table: committed baseline (pointer everywhere + 3 barriers) 24/48 insns; *ptr &= 0xF8 + symbol reads + symbol stores 23/50 (BEST, now in src/); *ptr &= 0xF8 + symbol reads + ptr stores 24/51; ptr reads + symbol stores 27/52; symbol-only s32 temps 28/47; symbol-only u8 temps 29/48; symbol-only + volatile 29/48.

- [s1] Residual defect 1 (address form): target keeps an UNFOLDED lui+addiu base register and uses it for both the block's load and the block's store ('0(a0)' twice). Our builds only keep the base unfolded when a pointer local has >=2 memory uses; whenever an address expression feeds exactly one memory operand, combine folds %lo into that operand and the base register disappears.

- [s1] Residual defect 2 (delay slot): because our reload's address is produced by a lui immediately before it, the scheduler must emit the reload ahead of 'lw v0,0x20(a1)', leaving a nop in the lw load-delay slot on every block. In target the base is already live so the reload sinks into that delay slot. This defect is downstream of defect 1 and should resolve with it.

- [s1] Central unresolved tension, measured from four directions: getting the reloads (needs mismatched address expressions) and getting the shared unfolded base (needs one address expression feeding two mems) are mutually exclusive under every C spelling tried this session. Target has both simultaneously, so some cse_insn condition declines to RECORD the MEM destination while still CSE-ing the address - that condition has not yet been identified.

- [s1] No cc1 -da RTL dump has been taken for this function yet; every conclusion above is inferred from objdump. The .cse/.combine dumps would settle the central tension directly and should precede any further blind spelling sweeps.

- [s1] src/code6cac_b.c:4044 already spells 'src1 = (&D_80106A73) - 3;', so the surrounding code treats 0x80106A70..0x80106A73 as one contiguous 4-byte region - a struct/array re-derivation is an untried modality. Caveat: target addresses the flag byte via %hi/%lo(D_80106A73) at offset 0 but the copy destination via %lo(D_80106A70)($at), so a naive g[3] spelling would introduce displacements target does not have.

- [s1] PROCESS NOTE for the next session: the 23-point form currently in src/ has a 'ptr' local with exactly ONE use ('*ptr &= 0xF8;'). That is the 'why is this here?' smell from the cheat checklist - a one-use pointer alias to a global whose only observable effect is on GCC's CSE table. It is banked as the best MEASURED floor, NOT as a submittable form; do not send it to a Judge as-is.
