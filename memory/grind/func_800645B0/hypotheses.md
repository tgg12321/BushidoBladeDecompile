# Hypotheses — func_800645B0

## Session 1 (2026-08-12, recon)

### H1 — CONFIRMED. The target is a natural nested loop, not the goto chain HEAD carried.
Rewrote as nested do/while with `break`, deleted both `register asm()` pins:
21 -> 17; the callee-save assignments ($s3 accumulator, $s2 mask) snapped to
target immediately.

### H2 — CONFIRMED. loop.c hoists the constant `1` out of the inner loop, costing two instructions.
`mask = 1 << idx` gives a single-set loop-invariant pseudo; `scan_loop` /
`move_movables` hoist it into a fresh callee-save $s4 (save/restore pair,
81 insns vs 78). Fix: route the constant through a scratch variable that is
also assigned a genuinely-used loop-variant value later in the same loop
([[defeat-licm-hoist-var-reuse]]). 17 -> 10, build_insns 81 -> 78, and the
shared pseudo lands in $v1 — the register the target uses for both roles.

### H3 — CONFIRMED. The $v1/$a0 swap is a reference-count ordering, closable by making the scratch the OR destination.
`val = val | mask; D_800A3444 = val;` instead of `D_800A3444 = val | mask;`.
10 -> 3; val=$v1, j=$a0, and the in-place `or $v1,$v1,$s2` matched.

### H4 — CONFIRMED BUT BANNED. The final residual is a loop-top emission-order effect that an interposed statement flips.
An 8-variant hand sweep found `j += 1;` placed between `idx = i + j;` and
`val = 1;` closes 3 -> 0. The layer-1 cheat-reviewer FAILed it: a statement
relocation with no independent semantic reason, chosen from a directed sweep
purely to flip a scheduler/reorg outcome. It is now a BANNED construct.
Session 2 superseded the *diagnosis* as well — see H5.

## Session 2 (2026-08-12, recon)

### H5 — CONFIRMED. The loop-top residual is sched.c's `birthing_insn_p` register-pressure bonus, not a source-order tie; it is removable by making `idx` multi-set.
- **Mechanism:** `sched.c:birthing_insn_p` returns `reg_n_sets[dest] == 1` for
  a live destination, and `adjust_priority` raises that insn's INSN_PRIORITY
  to `max_priority`. The scheduler is a backward list scheduler, so a bonused
  insn is selected early and emitted LAST in the block. With `idx` single-set,
  `addu idx,i,j` is bonused and `li val,1` lands first in the block; reorg.c
  steals the block's first insn into the inner back-edge delay slot, where the
  target has the `addu`.
- **Probe:** `cc1 -da` on the real build, per-function extraction of
  `t.i.sched` (`tmp/grind/func_800645B0/s1/{dump.sh,extract.py}`); then the
  same dump with `idx` made multi-set (`idx2 = idx << 1; idx = idx2 + idx;`).
- **Result:** ready list at T-6 goes from `31 (1) 28 (7f000001), now 28 31` to
  `31 (1) 28 (1), now 31 28` — the bonus disappears, source order is restored
  by the INSN_LUID tie-break, `addu` is emitted first and lands in the
  back-edge delay slot exactly as target. Score still 3, but the residual has
  MOVED off the loop top entirely (see H6). This replaces the banned lever
  with a construct in a sanctioned family (variable reuse for codegen control)
  that the target's own allocation mirrors ($s0 = i+j, then the sum, then the
  byte offset).

### H6 — CONFIRMED (as a characterisation). The remaining 3 points are two independent effects around the first `rand()` call, and A_base vs K currently trade one for the other.
- Target: `jal rand` with `sll $s1,$s0,1` in the delay slot, then
  `addu $s0,$s1,$s0`. K: `sll` before the call, `addu $s0,$s0,$s1` in the
  delay slot.
- (a) In target the `*3` sum is emitted AFTER the call, because the original
  left it INLINE in the store's address expression (GCC expands the
  call-bearing RHS first). K hoists it into its own statement ahead of the
  first store, so it precedes the call and reorg fills the slot with it.
  A_base (inline sum) gets this region byte-exact.
- (b) The commutative PLUS operands print as (idx, idx2) here, (idx2, idx) in
  target; cse.c `fold_rtx`'s `must_swap` canonicalisation (cse.c:5278ff) is
  what fixes the order.

### H7 — KILLED. Declaration order does not control the commutative PLUS operand order.
Pseudo numbers DO follow declaration order (t.i.combine: i=72 j=73 idx=74
idx2=75 mask=76 val=77), but declaring `idx2` before `idx` (Q), before `idx`
with the `* 3` spelling (R), and first of all locals (S) all leave
`addu $s0,$s0,$s1` and score 3. The SOTN "named-intermediate declaration
order" family is spent on this residual.

### H8 — KILLED. Spelling the stride as a multiply does not help.
`idx * 3` is byte-identical to `idx2 + idx` (L/N == K, 3/78). `idx * 12`
(M/O) costs an extra instruction (79) because the `idx * 2` value stops being
shared with the s16 store; `P` (idx2 as a plain copy, s16 index `idx2 * 2`)
regresses to 21/81.

## Session 3 (2026-08-12, structural) — floor 3 -> 1

### H9 — CONFIRMED. Both of the previous session's residuals close simultaneously if the *3 sum is assigned to `idx` AND the first `rand()` is named into a temp ahead of it.
- **Mechanism:** the sum is a real second set of `idx`, killing the
  `birthing_insn_p` bonus at the loop top; and naming the call puts the CALL
  before the sum in source order, so GCC emits the sum after the `jal` and
  reorg.c fills the delay slot with the `sll` (the target's shape) instead of
  with the sum.
- **Probe:** sweep6.py variants AA/AB/AC (+ control AD, call named but sum
  inline).
- **Result:** AA/AB/AC = **1 / 78** (previous floor 3); AD = 3 / 78. The
  unmasked diff drops from three real pairs to one.
- **Verdict:** CONFIRMED — this is the session's floor move.

### H10 — KILLED. A second assignment to `idx` that CSE/copy-prop can fold does not remove the birthing bonus.
- **Mechanism claim tested:** `reg_n_sets` is a whole-function count, so ANY
  second assignment should do. False in practice — the count is taken after the
  fold passes, so a copy / split-init / recomputation of a live value leaves
  `reg_n_sets == 1`.
- **Probe:** sweep5 (T_split `idx = i; idx += j;`, U_half `idx = idx << 1;`
  after the stores, V_both, W_late) plus sweep11 (FA/FB/FC/FD, the halfword
  offset re-assigned into `idx` three ways); `.sched` dumps of A_base and
  U_half compared directly.
- **Result:** all nine variants 3 / 78, and the two `.sched` dumps carry an
  identical ready list `T-6: 31 (1) 28 (7f000001), now 28 31`.
- **Verdict:** KILLED.

### H11 — KILLED (and mechanism corrected). The commutative operand order of the sum is NOT a cse.c `fold_rtx`/`must_swap` effect and no source spelling changes it.
- **Mechanism (corrected):** `optabs.c:399-417`, `expand_binop` — for a
  commutative optab GCC swaps op0/op1 when `target == op1`. `idx = idx2 + idx;`
  therefore expands as `(plus idx idx2)` *in the .rtl dump*, before cse runs.
- **Probe:** sweep7 (eight respellings: `idx + idx2`, `idx += idx2`,
  declaration swap, `idx2 = idx + idx`, `idx2 = idx * 2`, call before the
  shift, `idx * 3`), plus a read of `dump_AA/f_rtl.txt` insn 53 and of
  optabs.c.
- **Result:** all eight = 1 / 78 with the identical `addu s0,s0,s1`. The
  previous session's frontier item 3 (vary the cse equivalence class) is
  therefore misdirected and is retired.
- **Verdict:** KILLED — the fix must change the assignment DESTINATION, not the
  operand syntax.

### H12 — KILLED. Giving the sum its own destination variable fixes the operand order but cannot keep the loop top, because of local_alloc ordering.
- **Mechanism:** `local_alloc` precedes `global_alloc`; the byte-offset value is
  normally a high-priority BLOCK-LOCAL pseudo that claims `$s0` before the
  block-local `idx2` (which overlaps it) can, and the multi-block `idx` then
  re-uses `$s0`. Routing the byte offset through `idx` removes that claimant,
  so `idx2` takes `$s0` and `idx` is pushed to `$s1`.
- **Probe:** sweep8 (CA/CB/CC/CD), sweep9 (DA/DB/DC/DD/DE), sweep10 (five
  declaration orders), with `.lreg`/`.greg` dumps of DA and AA and a read of
  `global.c:allocno_compare`.
- **Result:** CA = 3 / 78 (operand order + every register right, loop top
  wrong); DA = 12 / 78 (loop top + operand order right, `$s0`/`$s1` swapped);
  declaration order moves nothing.
- **Verdict:** KILLED as written; the underlying constraint (byte offset must
  stay block-local) is now a hard fact for any future shape.

### H13 — KILLED. Recomputing `i + j` as the sum's right operand to dodge the expand-time swap costs a real instruction.
- **Probe:** sweep12 GA/GB/GC/GD.
- **Result:** 19 / **79** (GA/GB/GC) and 13 / **79** (GD) — CSE does not fold
  the recomputation away.
- **Verdict:** KILLED.

## Frontier

0. **The last point: emit `(plus idx2 idx)` while keeping a real second set of
   `idx` and a block-local byte offset.** Mechanism: the three constraints are
   (a) `expand_binop` swaps when the sum's `target == op1`, so the sum's dest
   must not be `idx`; (b) `birthing_insn_p` needs `reg_n_sets[idx] > 1` with a
   set that survives the fold passes; (c) the byte offset must stay a
   block-local pseudo or `local_alloc` hands `$s0` to `idx2`. Every pairwise
   combination has now been measured; no shape satisfying all three has been
   found. Next probe: attack (b) from the other side instead — make the
   const-1 pseudo SINGLE-set so `li val,1` is bonused too (with both insns at
   max_priority the tie falls to INSN_LUID and the dump shows the LATER insn
   picked first, i.e. `addu` emitted first — see the `52/63` and `52/61` ready
   lines in `dump_AA/f_sched.txt`), while preventing loop.c from hoisting it
   (a plain single-set `val = 1;` is a movable and costs 81 insns). Read
   loop.c's `move_movables` preconditions (`m->cond`, `m->global`, the
   `threshold` register-pressure test at loop.c:532), dump `t.i.loop` for the
   AA build to see which test the current const-1 passes, and construct a C
   shape that fails exactly one of them.

1. ~~**Get `idx` multi-set WITHOUT hoisting the sum ahead of the first call.**~~
   **RESOLVED by H9** (session 3): naming the first `rand()` into `last` does
   exactly this and moved the floor 3 -> 1. The paragraph below is kept only
   for its reasoning trail; the "enumerate second assignments" half of it is
   KILLED by H10 (foldable second sets are inert).
   Mechanism: `birthing_insn_p` counts `reg_n_sets` over the WHOLE function,
   while the delay-slot fill only depends on whether the sum statement sits
   before or after the call-bearing store. If a second, semantically-real
   assignment to `idx` exists anywhere else in the function while the sum
   stays inline in the store addresses (A_base's shape), both residuals close
   at once. Next probe: enumerate genuinely-used second assignments of the
   slot index (e.g. the index reused as the s16 element index, or the outer
   accumulator and the slot index sharing one variable) and sandbox each;
   reject any candidate whose second assignment is dead or unread.

2. **Attack the bonus from the other side: make the const-1 pseudo single-set
   AND unhoistable, so BOTH insns are bonused.** With both at max_priority the
   tie falls to INSN_LUID and source order is restored without touching `idx`.
   Mechanism: a single-set const-1 is normally a loop.c movable; find a
   spelling where `move_movables` rejects it (read loop.c's movable
   preconditions — `m->cond`, `m->global`, the `threshold` register-pressure
   test at loop.c:532 — and derive which C shape violates one) while
   `reg_n_sets == 1` still holds. Next probe: instrument/read loop.c's
   rejection reasons on the current build, then construct the shape.

3. ~~**Attack the commutative operand order through CSE state rather than
   syntax.**~~ **RETIRED by H11** (session 3): the operand order is fixed at
   RTL expansion by `expand_binop`'s `target == op1` swap, not by cse; the
   `.rtl` dump already shows the swapped form. Original text below. H7 killed declaration order and H8 killed the multiply spelling;
   what has NOT been probed is the CSE hash-table state at the point the sum
   is folded (cse.c `fold_rtx` must_swap). Next probe: dump `t.i.cse2` for the
   sum insn and identify which equivalence class supplies the swap, then vary
   what else is in that class (e.g. whether `idx * 2` is a named local or an
   inline expression, and whether the s16 store's use of it precedes or
   follows the word stores in source order).

## [s1] The distance-3 residual at the legitimate baseline (session 1 constructs 1-3, `j += 1;` at its natural position) is caused by sched.c's birthing_insn_p register-pressure bonus, not by a source-order/LUID tie, and is removable by making `idx` multi-set.
- mechanism: tools/gcc-2.7.2/sched.c:birthing_insn_p returns reg_n_sets[dest]==1 for a destination live at that point; adjust_priority then raises that insn's INSN_PRIORITY to max_priority. The list scheduler runs BACKWARD, so a bonused insn is selected first and therefore emitted LAST in the block. With `idx` single-set, `addu idx,i,j` is bonused and `li val,1` (val is set 3x, no bonus) lands first in the inner-loop block; reorg.c then steals the block's first insn into the inner back-edge delay slot, where the target has `addu $s0,$s3,$a0`.
- probe: cc1 -da on the real build (tmp/grind/func_800645B0/s1/dump.sh), per-function extraction of t.i.sched and t.i.combine (extract.py), read of sched.c:birthing_insn_p/adjust_priority/rank_for_schedule, then the same dump with `idx` made multi-set via `idx2 = idx << 1; idx = idx2 + idx;`.
- result: Ready list at T-6 goes from `31 (1) 28 (7f000001), now 28 31` to `31 (1) 28 (1), now 31 28`. The bonus disappears, the INSN_LUID tie-break restores source order, `addu` is emitted first in the block and lands in the back-edge delay slot exactly as target. The li/addu diff pair is gone from the unmasked diff.
- verdict: CONFIRMED

## [s1] The remaining 3 points at the new baseline are two independent effects around the first rand() call: the *3 sum must be emitted AFTER the call (so reorg fills the jal delay slot with the `sll`), and the commutative PLUS operands must print as (idx2, idx).
- mechanism: GCC expands a call-bearing RHS before the store's address arithmetic, so an INLINE `(idx2 + idx) << 2` offset lands after the jal (target's shape); hoisting the sum into its own statement ahead of the first store puts it before the call, and reorg.c fills the delay slot with it instead of the sll. Separately, cse.c fold_rtx's must_swap canonicalisation (cse.c:5278ff) fixes the commutative operand order regardless of how it is written in C.
- probe: Side-by-side unmasked instruction listing of target vs build (tmp/grind/func_800645B0/s1/listing.py) at indices 14-31.
- result: target 18-20 = `jal rand` / `sll s1,s0,1` (delay) / `addu s0,s1,s0`; build = `sll s1,s0,1` / `jal rand` / `addu s0,s0,s1`. Everything else in the function is identical (78/78; other pairs are section-offset branch addresses only). The old baseline (inline sum) gets this region byte-exact but has the loop top wrong, so the two residuals are currently mutually exclusive.
- verdict: CONFIRMED

## [s1] Declaration order controls the commutative PLUS operand order, so declaring `idx2` before `idx` will emit `addu $s0,$s1,$s0`.
- mechanism: GCC 2.7.2 assigns local pseudos at expand_decl time, so pseudo numbers follow declaration order (confirmed in t.i.combine: i=72, j=73, idx=74, idx2=75, mask=76, val=77); if cse's commutative canonicalisation ordered operands by regno, swapping the declarations would swap the emitted operands.
- probe: sweep4.py: Q_declswap (idx2 immediately before idx), R_declswap_mul3 (same with the sum written `idx * 3`), S_idx2_first (idx2 declared first of all locals).
- result: All three score 3 / 78 insns with `addu $s0,$s0,$s1` unchanged. The SOTN 'named-intermediate declaration order' family is spent on this residual.
- verdict: KILLED

## [s1] Spelling the 12-byte stride as a multiply (`idx * 3` / `idx * 12`) reproduces the target's operand order, because expmed.c's synth_mult expands x*3 as (plus (ashift x 1) x) with the shift result first.
- mechanism: synth_mult builds the multiply RTL directly rather than through the C-level PLUS, so its operand order might escape cse's commutative canonicalisation.
- probe: sweep3.py: L_mul3_mul2, N_mul3_shift2, M_mul12_mul2, O_mul12_shift2, P_mul12_only.
- result: `* 3` is byte-identical to the explicit `idx2 + idx` (L/N == K: 3 / 78) — synth_mult's order does not survive canonicalisation. `* 12` regresses to 12 / 79 because the `idx * 2` value stops being shared with the D_800F0BCC s16 store; P_mul12_only regresses to 21 / 81.
- verdict: KILLED

## [s2] Both of the previous session's residuals (the loop-top emission order and the jal delay-slot fill) close simultaneously if the *3 word-index sum is assigned back into `idx` AND the first rand() call is named into the existing `last` temp ahead of it.
- mechanism: The sum is a REAL second set of `idx`, so reg_n_sets[idx] == 2 and sched.c's birthing_insn_p bonus no longer fires on `addu idx,i,j`; the inner-loop block emits `addu` first and reorg.c steals it into the back-edge delay slot as target. Independently, naming the call puts the CALL ahead of the sum in source order, so GCC emits the sum after the `jal` and reorg fills the jal delay slot with the `sll` rather than with the sum.
- probe: tmp/grind/func_800645B0/s2/sweep6.py variants AA (first rand() named), AB (every rand() named), AC (sum spelled `idx * 3`), plus control AD (call named, sum left inline); each scored with `sandbox func_800645B0 --disable all` and diffed unmasked with diffvar6.py.
- result: AA/AB/AC = score 1, build_insns 78 (previous floor 3); AD = 3/78. The unmasked diff drops from three real pairs (li/addu swap at the loop top and back edge, plus the operand order) to one (the operand order).
- verdict: CONFIRMED

## [s2] Any second assignment to `idx` anywhere in the function removes the birthing_insn_p bonus, because reg_n_sets is a whole-function count.
- mechanism: reg_n_sets is recomputed by reg_scan/flow AFTER cse, combine and copy propagation, so a second set whose value is already available in another live pseudo is folded away before the count is taken.
- probe: sweep5.py (T_split `idx = i; idx += j;`, U_half `idx = idx << 1;` after the stores with the s16 store using `idx`, V_both, W_late `idx = idx2 + idx;` after stores that already compute the sum inline) and sweep11.py (FA/FB/FC/FD: the halfword offset re-assigned into `idx` as `<<1`, `+idx`, `*2`); plus a direct comparison of the extracted t.i.sched blocks for A_base and U_half.
- result: All nine variants score 3 / 78, and the two .sched dumps carry a byte-identical inner-loop ready list (`;; ready list at T-6: 31 (1) 28 (7f000001), now 28 31`). A reg_n_sets lever needs a set whose VALUE is not already live.
- verdict: KILLED

## [s2] The commutative operand order of the *3 sum (`addu s0,s1,s0` in target vs `addu s0,s0,s1` in our build) is a cse.c fold_rtx/must_swap effect that can be steered by respelling the expression.
- mechanism: CORRECTED: it is optabs.c:399-417 (expand_binop), which swaps op0/op1 for a commutative optab whenever `target == op1` (or op1 is a REG and op0 is not). `idx = <x> + idx;` therefore expands as (plus idx x) at RTL EXPANSION, before cse ever runs.
- probe: sweep7.py, eight respellings (`idx = idx + idx2`, `idx += idx2`, declaration swap, `idx2 = idx + idx`, `idx2 = idx * 2`, call before the shift, `idx = idx * 3`, s16-offset variation); plus reading the expand dump tmp/grind/func_800645B0/s2/dump_AA/f_rtl.txt (insn 53) and tools/gcc-2.7.2/optabs.c.
- result: All eight measure 1 / 78 with the identical `addu s0,s0,s1`, and the .rtl dump already carries `(plus (reg 74=idx) (reg 75=idx2))` — the swap is pre-cse. The previous session's frontier item 'vary the cse equivalence class' is retired as misdirected.
- verdict: KILLED

## [s2] Giving the *3 sum its own destination variable fixes the operand order and can be combined with a real second set of `idx` (the byte offset) to reach 0.
- mechanism: local_alloc runs BEFORE global_alloc. The 12-byte-stride byte offset is normally a BLOCK-LOCAL CSE temp with high allocno priority (floor_log2(n_refs)*n_refs/live_length, global.c:allocno_compare), so it claims $s0 first; the block-local `idx2`, whose range overlaps it, is pushed to $s1; the multi-block `idx` then re-uses $s0. Routing the byte offset through `idx` removes that early claimant, so `idx2` takes $s0 and `idx` is forced to $s1.
- probe: sweep8.py (CA/CB/CC third local `wid` for the sum; CD sum before the call), sweep9.py (DA/DB/DC/DD/DE byte offset routed through `idx`), sweep10.py (five declaration orders on the DA shape), with .lreg/.greg dumps of DA and AA and a read of global.c:allocno_compare.
- result: CA = 3/78: operand order and EVERY register correct, only the loop top wrong. DA = 12/78: loop top and operand order both correct, but idx=$s1 / idx2=$s0 where target has idx=$s0 / idx2=$s1, renaming 12 points. All five declaration orders on DA stay at 12/78 (second independent confirmation that declaration order is dead here).
- verdict: KILLED

## [s2] Writing the sum's right operand as a recomputation of the slot index (`idx = idx2 + (i + j);`) makes op1 a fresh pseudo at expand time, dodging the `target == op1` swap at zero cost because CSE folds the recomputation back onto `idx`.
- mechanism: expand_binop's swap test compares the assignment target against op1 by rtx identity, so a recomputed temp escapes it; CSE was expected to eliminate the duplicate `addu` afterwards.
- probe: sweep12.py GA (`idx = idx2 + (i + j)`), GB (`(i + j) + idx2`), GC (`idx2 + i + j`), GD (`idx2 = (i+j) << 1; idx = idx2 + (i+j);`).
- result: GA/GB/GC = 19 / 79 insns, GD = 13 / 79 — the recomputed addu SURVIVES (one instruction over the 78-instruction target) and cascades the allocation. Axis dead; it was also the only shape this session that would have needed a cheat-checklist defence, and the measurement settles it without one.
- verdict: KILLED
