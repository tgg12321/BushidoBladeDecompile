# Hypothesis ledger — func_800460E4

## [s1] 2026-08-25 (recon)

H1 — "The four addu operand-order rules (@76/@102/@129/@165) correspond to the
scaled-index `(s3 << 2)` address computations, and the offset-first order is
produced by spelling them as an integer sum with the shift term first."
Probe: rewrote the four sites; measured.
- Sub-result: `&s0[s3]` spelling measured FLAT (base-first) — KILLED as a
  spelling; `(s32 *)((s3 << 2) + (s32)s0)` measured to flip all four sites.
Verdict: **CONFIRMED** (35 → 32 combined with H2's alias drop; diff inspection
shows all four sites now offset-first, matching target).

H2 — "Dropping the p/p2 param-alias locals (direct `((s32*)arg1)[s3]` reads)
is byte-neutral and raises arg1's pseudo ref count."
Probe: dropped both; measured + .greg/solver extract.
Verdict: **CONFIRMED byte-neutral; NOT sufficient for the rotation** (residual
32 still the pure 3-seat rotation; arg1 pri 3703 < s2 pri 4444).

H3 — "The 3-way rotation exists because the original had arg1 and the s1 local
as ONE variable (the param reused as the func_80045600-argument carrier); the
merged pseudo's ref count lifts its global.c priority above the s2 pointer so
it is allocated first and takes $s1, cascading s2→$s2, s3→$s3."
Probe: ra_solver simulate (17/17 ground-truth match) + inverse (REACHABLE, all
22 vectors refs_up on 73/80; honest split ref-counts already equal target's
visible uses, so a split-pseudo original is arithmetically excluded) → merged
the variable in C; measured.
Verdict: **CONFIRMED — sandbox 0** (35 → 0 total this session).

Frontier: (empty — function at sandbox 0; remaining work is integration:
rule retirement via the normal retire path + Judge gates.)
