# Hypothesis ledger — func_80041188

## s1 (recon, 2026-08-21) — frontier established

Chassis re-verified this session: HEAD honest floor 27 (canonical verdict C,
132/132 insns); candidate.c applied to src/text1a_pre.c scores **5** — identical
to the wip-import floor, so every banked conclusion in evidence.md remains
chassis-valid. The residual is byte-identical to the recorded 5-insn loop-2
cluster (fdiff re-run this session):

```
  addiu s3,s7,32   vs  addiu s6,s7,32     (loop2's a4+0x20 gets own reg s3)
  move  a1,s3      vs  move  a1,s6        (x2)
  move  a0,s7      vs  lw a0,88(sp)       (param-substitution stack reload)
  move  a2,s8      (ordering shift from the above)
```

All three hypotheses are grounded in the banked ALLOCDBG arithmetic
(pri = floor_log2(nrefs)*nrefs/livelen*10000) and the RA-solver session's
sufficient-pair list (evidence.md §RA-solver). The open problem is a **+1
reference lever**: every spelling found so far moves reg_n_refs by +2
(split-init) or 0 (alias copies, propagated away pre-flow).

### H1 — realize a solver pair on the split model (out2b for loop2)
- **Statement:** the real split spelling (separate out2b local for loop2)
  lands out2b in s3 (model-confirmed 12/12) but currently re-shuffles
  {loop1-out, a4, saved} into a 3-cycle (sandbox 16). One of the solver's
  sufficient PAIRS — (86 refs+1 & 86 pref+22), (79 refs+1 & 86 refs+1),
  (77 pref->23 & 86 live-8) — fixes the shuffle.
- **Mechanism:** global.c allocno priority ordering + expand_preferences
  (copy-preference to hard reg 22).
- **Probe:** `tmp/hw_split2.sh --keep`, extract the split-variant allocno
  table, compare pseudo 86's ACTUAL nrefs/pri vs the model's prediction —
  the last tested split-init spelling did NOT materialize the predicted +1
  (copy-propagated before flow). Diagnose where the ref dies, then pick the
  next pair spelling. Dumps: `pwsh tools/grinder/dump.ps1 func_80041188`,
  read .lreg/.greg for reg_n_refs, .combine for the copy-prop.

### H2 — duplicated-statement-into-arms as the missing +1 ref-lift
- **Statement:** a REAL out2- (or tbl-) referencing statement duplicated into
  two control-flow arms raises that pseudo's reg_n_refs by 1 when cross-jump
  re-merges the copies byte-neutrally — exactly the +1 no other spelling
  reaches (split-init = +2, alias = 0). Target windows: split-out2b needs
  nrefs 4 at livelen 42-76 (pri into (1052,1666)); alternatively tbl nrefs
  4→5 (1666→2083) so a 1904 split-out2 slots between tbl and the carrier.
- **Mechanism:** flow.c counts reg_n_refs before jump2's cross-jump merge;
  sanctioned family `.claude/rules/duplicated-statement-into-arms.md` — "the
  proven byte-free ref-lift for global-RA priority walls" (motion_SetMotion).
  Prereqs: byte-neutrality verified + exhaustion + FAKE annotation + reviews.
  NOTE: this function is two straight-line loop bodies; the only arms are the
  loop-exit conditionals, so the duplication site must be constructed around
  `if (i < 0x12/0x14)` — feasibility is the first thing to measure.
- **Probe:** read the rule file end-to-end first; then duplicate one real
  statement (e.g. the out2 re-init or a tbl advance) into exit-vs-fallthrough
  arms, verify build_insns==132, read .greg nrefs delta.

### H3 — restore `move a0,s7` without the parameter substitution
- **Statement:** lever 4 (param a4 at loop2's func_800523E0) buys the s6/s7
  pairing but costs the `lw a0,88(sp)` reload. A different spelling that
  keeps the carrier's pri below out2's 1333 (carrier nrefs <= 5) while
  passing the CARRIER at that call would close 2 of the 5 residual insns.
- **Mechanism:** global.c priority (carrier nrefs 7→5 was worth 1473→1052);
  solver pair (77 pref->23 & 86 live-8) names an alternative route.
- **Probe:** sweep carrier-reference-reducing spellings at OTHER a4 sites
  (evidence.md says non-func_800523E0 substitutions cost an instruction —
  those exact sites are dead; the untried surface is reducing refs via the
  out2 re-init spelling, e.g. deriving loop2's out2 from saved/base instead
  of the carrier, which also serves H1's 86 live-8).

## [s1] The wip-import floor of 5 is still valid on the current main chassis, and the residual is the same 5-insn loop-2 cluster recorded in the WIP notes.
- mechanism: chassis check: rule-era committed body (register pin + 16 rules) scores 27 honest; candidate.c is pure C and rule-independent
- probe: canonical + sandbox at HEAD (27), applied candidate.c to src/text1a_pre.c, sandbox again (5), fdiff vs build/src/text1a_pre.o reference
- result: floor 5 reproduced, 132/132 insns; fdiff shows exactly: addiu s3,s7,32 vs addiu s6,s7,32; move a1,s3 vs move a1,s6 (x2); move a0,s7 + move a1,s3/a2,s8 vs lw a0,88(sp) reorder — identical to the banked cluster
- verdict: CONFIRMED

## [s1] A sibling/duplicate analog exists that shortcuts the residual.
- mechanism: duplicate-lead scan
- probe: grep tmp/duplicates_leads.txt for func_80041188; source annotation check
- result: no entry; only a Kengo naming lead (my_hirahira/hirahira_w_ctrl), no transplantable body
- verdict: KILLED
