# Hypothesis ledger — func_8002D518

## H1 — canonical island respell restores insn parity and lowers the floor
- **Statement:** respelling the pinned `.word` island in the
  func_800274BC-accepted canonical form makes the sandbox stop stripping it
  and byte-matches the island.
- **Probe [s1]:** applied the respell, ran `sandbox --disable all`.
- **Result:** floor 33 -> 30; build_insns 141 -> 144 == target; all 7 island
  words verified exact against target.
- **Verdict: CONFIRMED** (edit in place in src).

## H2 — a fresh local copy `u32 ud = disc;` reproduces target's second
##      disc register ($a0 copy in the beqz delay slot)
- **Statement:** target's `addu $a0,$a2,$zero` delay-slot copy (consumed by
  the island input + `srlv`) comes from a second C variable holding disc.
- **Probe [s1], spelling A:** `u32 ud = disc;` first stmt of the outer else;
  asm input `"r"(ud)`, shift `ud >> shift`. Result: copy FOLDED — no copy
  insn, everything reads $4, delay slot nop. Floor 30.
- **Probe [s1], spelling B:** same but asm input `"r"(disc)` and only the
  `srlv` reads `ud` (betting on the volatile-asm cse flush + cross-bb
  combine barrier). Result: identical — copy folded, floor 30, byte-identical
  build to spelling A.
- **Verdict: KILLED for these two spellings** (plain fresh-local copy, either
  operand arrangement). The hypothesis that a second VARIABLE existed remains
  live — what is killed is the plain-copy spelling. Next probes, in order:
  1. **Attribute the fold** (mandatory before more spellings):
     `pwsh tools/grinder/dump.ps1 func_8002D518`, read `.cse` (canon_reg
     replacement of ud's uses -> disc?) and `.combine` (single-use copy
     fold?). The delay-slot placement in target proves the copy survived to
     reorg in the original — identify which pass kills ours.
  2. `.claude/rules/cse-block-extension-controls-fold-span.md` escapes — the
     else block is reached via `beqz` whose target label has LABEL_NUSES==1,
     so cse1's extended block carries disc's equivalence into it. A real
     if/else restructure whose arm ends in jump+BARRIER is the one free
     escape (measured on func_8003B9D0).
  3. Sanctioned-family spellings if honest ones die: staged-value through an
     existing dead local (`staged-value-reused-variable`), param reuse
     (`threshold = disc;` — threshold is dead after the entrance chains),
     duplicated-statement-into-arms. Each needs its rule read + prerequisites
     honored BEFORE writing it.

## H3 — the remaining ~30 is one coupled register-allocation cascade
- **Statement:** disc-in-$a2 (freed by H2's surviving copy taking $a0) is
  the head of the cascade; dist_sq->$5, sqrt_val->$6, t1/t2 $3/$4 swap, and
  result->$5 follow from it plus at most small ordering levers (the two flips
  in evidence.md item 3).
- **Probe:** none yet (s1 is recon). Re-measure the whole map after H2 lands;
  only then attack the two ordering flips separately (mult-cascade dist_sq
  placement; div-prep denom sll placement) if they survive.
- **Verdict: OPEN** — do not spend spellings on #2/#3 diffs until H2 is
  resolved; they are likely coupled.

## [s1] Respelling the pinned .word LZCS/LZCR island in the func_800274BC-accepted canonical form stops the sandbox stripping it and byte-matches the island
- mechanism: engine cheat-stripper removes register-asm pins and .word GP bridges but keeps the canonical single-__asm__ cop2 form; %1 operand resolves to $a0 naturally so all 7 island words encode exactly as target
- probe: applied respell to src/code6cac_b.c, sandbox func_8002D518 --disable all, objdump word-compare of island region
- result: floor 33->30; build_insns 141->144 == target; island words 0x00806021/0x488CF000/nops/0x03A06021/0xE99F0000/0x8FA30000 all exact
- verdict: CONFIRMED

## [s1] A plain fresh local copy (u32 ud = disc;) reproduces target's second disc register (the addu $a0,$a2,$zero beqz-delay-slot copy feeding the island input and srlv)
- mechanism: original source must have carried disc in two pseudos; a fresh local is the naive spelling, but cse canon_reg / combine single-use fold coalesces the copy back into disc's pseudo
- probe: two spellings measured: (A) asm+srlv read ud; (B) asm reads disc, only srlv reads ud
- result: both fold: no copy insn emitted, delay slot stays nop, everything reads $4, floor unchanged at 30, byte-identical builds
- verdict: KILLED
