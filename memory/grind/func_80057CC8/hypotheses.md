# Hypothesis ledger — func_80057CC8

## [s1] Candidate.c (offset+table reassociation, s3 pin removed) replays to sandbox distance 3 on current main HEAD
- mechanism: Reassociating BOTH p-pointer adds from (table+offset) to (offset+table) lets GCC coalesce the offset temp into the pointer dest for the SECOND p (v1->v1). The first p still allocates a new pseudo (v0 sll/sra source, v1 addu dest) — the 3 remaining diffs are all from that one coalescing miss (addu v1,v0,a2 vs target addu v0,v0,a2, cascading to two lh base regs).
- probe: Applied candidate to src/text1b.c line 11837; ran `tools/wteng.ps1 main sandbox func_80057CC8 --disable all` and `canonical func_80057CC8`
- result: sandbox score=3, target_insns=111, build_insns=111, rules_dropped=7, cheat_asm_stripped=395; canonical verdict=C distance=3; objdump-confirmed the 3 diffs are addu dest v0 vs v1 and the two dependent lh base regs at 0x80057D54/0x80057D68/0x80057D6C
- verdict: CONFIRMED
