# hirahira_w_ctrl — WIP (opened 2026-08-04)

`src/text1a.c:753`. **16 regfix rules + 1 `tools/prologue_config.json` entry +
a register pin in source** (`register s32 *s7_a4 asm("s7") = a4;`) at HEAD.
No asmfix / frame_fix entries.

## Where it stands

| | score | frame | insns |
|---|---|---|---|
| committed HEAD | 27 | 72 | 132 |
| r1-r2 candidate | 23 | 72 | 132 |
| **`candidate.c` (r3-r16)** | **5** | 72 | 132 |
| target | 0 | 72 (`0x48`) | 132 |

Frame, instruction count, the prologue, the whole of loop 1, the schedule and
the epilogue all match target exactly. `candidate.c` is pure C — no register
pin, no `__asm__`, no volatile, no dead code.

**CORRECTION (operator, 2026-08-04 ~08:20) still stands: the pin retirement is
NOT a free commit.** It is inert under the honest sandbox but with the 16 regfix
rules ENABLED the emission shifts and the full build MISMATCHES (measured: SHA1
8e1160d1). The pin retires only as part of the COMPLETION, when all rules go.

## The residual: five instructions, one cluster

```
  72  TGT addiu s3,s7,32     OURS addiu s6,s7,32
  99  TGT move  a1,s3        OURS move  a1,s6
 110  TGT move  a0,s7        OURS move  a1,s6
 111  TGT move  a1,s3        OURS move  a2,s8
 112  TGT move  a2,s8        OURS lw    a0,88(sp)
```

Two causes: (a) target gives loop 2 its **own** `a4 + 0x20` register — `s3`,
shared with the by-then-dead loop1 `stptr` — where we reuse loop 1's `s6`;
(b) the parameter substitution that bought 17→11 costs a stack reload at
loop2's `func_800523E0` where target has `move a0,s7`.

## Method — ALLOCDBG priority arithmetic drove all of it

`pri = floor_log2(nrefs) * nrefs / livelen * 10000` (re-verified here). Tools:
`tmp/allocone.sh` (isolates the function into its own TU so there is no
block-alignment guesswork — allocno numbering, nrefs, livelen and pri are all
per-function, so an isolated compile gives the identical table), plus
`tmp/allocpick2.py` / `tmp/allocmatch.py` for the in-context log.

Allocno table of the 5-point form (all eight callee-saved registers now match
target):

| reg | role | nrefs | livelen | pri |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| s1 | a1 | 16 | 100 | 6400 |
| s2 | a2 | 16 | 100 | 6400 |
| s3 | stptr (loop1) | 7 | 41 | 3414 |
| s0 | stptr2 (loop2) | 6 | 47 | 2553 |
| s4 | i | 8 | 98 | 2448 |
| s5 | tbl | 4 | 48 | 1666 |
| s6 | out2 | 6 | 90 | 1333 |
| s7 | a4 carrier | 5 | 95 | 1052 |
| s8 | a3 | 4 | 100 | 800 |

## The six levers (27 → 5)

1. **destination reuse** `offset = offset + (s32) a2; p = (u16 *) offset;` (r1)
2. **initialise `i` before `tbl`** — target emits the s4 init pair before the s5
   pair; identical registers, different emission order. **23 → 19**
3. **`tbl++` after the first `func_8004A348` call** (not mid-buffer). sched1
   runs BEFORE register allocation in this toolchain, so schedule changes also
   move allocno live lengths. **19 → 17**
4. **loop2's `func_800523E0` takes the parameter `a4`**, not the local carrier.
   Drops the carrier allocno from nrefs 7 to 5 (pri 1473 → 1052) so `out2`
   (1333) outranks it: the s6/s7 pair lands target's way and all of loop 1 then
   matches instruction for instruction. **17 → 11**
5. **loop2 `stptr` as its own local + SPLIT-INIT on the loop1 `stptr`**
   (`stptr = base; stptr += 0xFC;`). The split-init raises stptr's nrefs 5 → 7
   (pri 2439 → 3414) **without changing a single emitted instruction** — that is
   what lets the loop2 split keep s3/s4 in target's order instead of swapping
   them. **11 → 6**
6. **`(s32)` cast on the first add's pointer operand**
   (`p = (u16 *) (offset + (s32) a1);`). **6 → 5**

All are sanctioned families (variable reuse / staged value, statement order,
split-init accumulation, param-local-alias). Nothing added, removed or
reordered a machine instruction: every probe held 132/132.

## Measured negatives — in git history (r16 commit); do not re-run the operand-order, split-init(+2), or alias(0) sweeps
## Resume here — the number to beat

Start from `candidate.c` (5). The task is a two-line spec:

> Give loop 2 its own `a4 + 0x20` allocno with **pri in (1052, 1666)** — at
> livelen 42 that needs nrefs 4, and nrefs 4 is only reachable together with a
> live range of 48–76 — **while restoring `move a0,s7`** at loop2's
> `func_800523E0` (i.e. finding a different way to hold the carrier's priority
> below `out2`'s 1333 than the parameter substitution).

Alternatively raise `tbl` from 1666 to ~2083 (nrefs 4 → 5) so that a split
`out2` at nrefs 4 / livelen 42 (1904) lands between `tbl` and `a4`. Both routes
need a **+1** reference lever; every one found so far moves +2 (split-init) or 0
(alias, copy-propagated). That is the open question.

The directed permuter is the untried rung — 132/132 at offset 0 with only five
instructions differing is a much better starting basin than saTan4FireDisp had.
Per [[grinder-permuter-orphan-stop-gate]] it must be supervised and harvested
inside the same session.

Instruments: tmp/hw*.py sweeps, tmp/hw_bank.py, tmp/sbs.sh, tmp/frame_probe.sh, tmp/allocdbg.sh, tmp/allocpick.py, tmp/perm_hw workspace.

## Permuter rung — CLOSED (2026-08-04, operator-supervised)

Campaign plus1ref on a clean 132/132 offset-0 pair from candidate-5: 62k
iters, 6 finds, best 120 — all WORSE than the candidate basin (the mutation
set cannot express the +1-reference lever; it moves whole statements, which
is the +2 class already killed manually). Stopped in-session, no orphan.
Ladder fully run. BANKED at 5 — the best floor in the active queue.
