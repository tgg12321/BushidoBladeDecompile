# cpu_side_move_dir_4 (system.c) - WIP, masked floor 2 (h5 form; ONE insn-pair left)

## TL;DR (SESSION 4 — current)
candidate.c = the h5 form: the owner-sanctioned staged-value-reused-variable
family (v0 = idx[1]; v0 <<= 2; arg5 = *(s32 *)(v0 + (s32)tbl_125c)) +
t0 multi-set chain + pp alias. **masked 2 / raw 2.** The staging strips the
lw5 LAUNCH (sched.c birthing_insn_p: multi-set dest) so the head re-times to
target; the v0+(s32)tbl spelling fixes the addu operand order.
Residual = the {sll4@54 <-> addu5@55} pair: both LAUNCH, luid-ordered
(A5-after-T0B forces sll4-first); flipping via A5-before-T0B hits the
p106/val5 [18,24]/[20,26] L6=L6 birth-tie (6). The v0-2nd-stage (v0=v0+tbl
as a stmt) collapses v0-var pri below t0 (t0 steals v0-hard, 15) - closed.
cnt-staging clashes with cnt's v1 loop role - closed. Double-staging d/e
families 15-17 - closed. ~40 forms measured this session.
**SESSION-4b — the g3 discovery (SECOND frontier, the pair FIXED):**
`v0<<=2; arg5=*(s32*)(v0+(s32)tbl); t0<<=2; call(..., *(s32*)(t0+(s32)
tbl_125c), arg5)` (t0's addu IN the call) = masked 6 / raw 6 with ORDER
PERFECT; residual = a pure v1<->a0 exchange (t0-chain vs arg5 value).
Mechanics (QTYDBG/lreg-verified): t0's qty ties the sll+in-call-addu
(p113: 6refs/span24 = pri 5000) and allocates BEFORE arg5 (p100:
2refs/span6 = 3333) -> t0 takes v1; target needs arg5 first (v1), t0
skipping to a0. Flip requires arg5-qty refs>=4 via a LOCAL copy-tie;
every vehicle measured dead: fresh single-set x folds back (k2=6=g3);
fn-scope carriers are global allocnos (permuter's status/temp finds ->
s0 spill, honest 6-8, REJECTED); v0-carrier scrambles (k1=16); a2v
presequence re-times the 11D5 chain (k3/k4=16-17); 2-ref t0 forms hit
the equiv-sink (h8*=14); t0*=4-late respellings re-time the head
(g1/g6/h7=14); plain re-measured 7/11. Sweeps: tmp/csmd4_{g,h2,h8,k,
f}_sweep.py, plain_now.py; tables tmp/csmd4_g3_{qty,pseudos}.py.
NEXT: (1) permuter now on the g3 base (weighted ~30 vs h5's 60 — richer
mutation neighborhood for stop-on-zero); (2) h5 base = still the masked
floor (2); candidate.c stays h5; (3) marionation region-1 = the same
pair — a twin crack transfers; g3 NOT yet mirrored onto marionation.
SESSION-5 ADDENDUM (2026-07-04, from the marionation deep-dive): target
bytes have the t0 chain IN-PLACE in $a0 => the original's sll never
LAUNCHED => the ORIGINAL SOURCE WAS THE g3 FAMILY. The pair is not to be
flipped in h5 (re-confirmed: t0<<=2 at same position = 7 here, 9 mar —
the *=4 temp's launch is head-load-bearing). Attack g3's v1/a0 qty
exchange instead: arg5-qty needs pri>=5000 (3refs/span6 ties, birth
order wins); untried class = multi-set arg5 VALUE-staging keeping the
lw-dest split. See marionation notes.md region-1 for the full argument.

## Prior sessions (3a-3d), one line each — details in git history
- 3d: carry-forms (val5 through a multi-set carrier) solve the ORDER half;
  THE STAGING THEOREM: locals allocate before globals; any lone address
  temp is LOCAL and steals v1 once val5 is carried. Best raw 8.
- 3b: split-addu frame achieves w=a0 (homing's mem-address = the in-call
  temp, not w). Faithful permuter workspace built (splice-compile fix:
  the permuter PRUNES other fn bodies; its pruned-TU metric is UNFAITHFUL
  — always re-verify finds via engine sandbox).
- 3a: cross-block reuse map (w = chain∪src a0-family, k = val∪-1 a3);
  the T1/T2 trap pair via set_preference one-level MEM unwrap.

## The decisive mechanism facts (all read from tools/gcc-2.7.2, verified by dumps)
- find_reg pass 0 excludes `regs_someone_prefers` (prefs of CONFLICTING
  lower-pri allocnos, merged by prune_preferences) and scans ASCENDING regno
  (no MIPS REG_ALLOC_ORDER) → a0 before a3 when both eligible.
- **COPY-pref upgrade short-circuits (`goto no_prefs`) BEFORE the full-pref
  loop** — an unfoldable `(set a0 (reg w))` reg-reg copy-pref would beat the
  a3 full-pref outright. Jalr-arg-temp attempt FAILED: cse folds a single-use
  load into the call homing (w vanishes from the jalr block).
- Preferences masked by AND_COMPL vs `used` — a3 enters `used` only via
  hard_reg_conflicts[w] (an a3-holding CONFLICTING allocno assigned BEFORE w).
- Priorities (ALLOCDBG, pri = floor_log2(refs)×refs/livelen×10000): w-inline
  16956 (13refs/23len), i 15555, temp 4210, -1holder 2142.
- adjust_priority: LAUNCH (0x7f000001) goes to insns passing birthing_insn_p
  = SET to live reg with **reg_n_sets==1** (flow-time). Multi-set dests never
  launch → staged loads place early-forward. THE sanctioned lever.
- schedule_select: loads beat ALU within a same-priority ready group;
  luid breaks LAUNCH-vs-LAUNCH ties.
- The a0-pref chain: the mul3 sll-temp gets a0 locally, and
  `(set t0 (plus renumbered-a0 base))` transfers an a0 full-pref into t0;
  ascending upgrade scan picks a0 before a3 (FINDREGDBG-verified).

## Ruled out (do NOT re-derive)
- G1-G4 hoists of D_800A11D5 (refs-2 equiv-sink puts the load back), inline-arg
  forms (14), dual temp-free chains D1-D8 (6-10), tie-battery of 10 arg5
  spellings (identical qty tables), 192-combo grid (floor 4), a2v hoists
  (14-16), jalr-temp copy-pref (cse-folded), arg5-first k-frames (hole is
  luid-invariant), k-value forms (21-25), reu-arg5 (chain grabs a0, 14).
- h-sweep interleavings: five orders all raw-2 with the identical pair-swap;
  sabc (A5-first) = 6 via the qty tie. Dead stores INERT (flow recounts).
- The 2026-07-01 "stretch the chain density" framing is SUPERSEDED.

## Pointers
- Probes: tmp/csmd4_{v0idx,half,h3,h_sweep,double,e_v0d,e_mul2,final_trace,
  vpabc_qty,verify_cand}.py (gitignored; regenerate from here).
- FINDREGDBG: BB2_FINDREG_DEBUG=<pseudo> (global.c find_reg); rebuild gccdbg
  with `make cc1 CFLAGS="-g -fgnu89-inline"` (c-gperf inline fix). Also
  BB2_SCHED_DEBUG / BB2_RANK_DEBUG / BB2_QTY_DEBUG / BB2_ALLOC_DEBUG; -dS
  gives the .sched dump (launching/blocking/ready lists).
- Permuter: tmp/perm_csmd4 (h5 base; compile.sh splices via
  tmp/csmd4_splice.py; launch permuter.py --best-only --stop-on-zero -j12).
- marionation_Exec: region-1 = the IDENTICAL residual pair (candidates
  mirrored); region-3 (arm-2 nop) is marionation-only.
- Target block: asm/funcs/cpu_side_move_dir_4.s lines 49-73.
