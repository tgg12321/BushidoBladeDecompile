# func_80062020 (text1b.c) — rejected match, sound loop-fix preserved

## TL;DR
orch3a matched this (commit `dfb9e9ac`, branch work/orch3a) but the fresh
adversarial retro-audit (audit-orch3a, 2026-06-14) FAILed it: the epilogue
smuggled a **dual-spelling addressing-mode steer**. The LOOP-BODY fix is sound
pure C and retires the 4 `register asm("$N")` pins; only the 3-store EPILOGUE
needs a legitimate form. Resume from the loop-fix, rewrite the epilogue
CONSISTENTLY, re-measure. NOT reintegrated to main — func_80062020 is still
INCOMPLETE (pins present at HEAD).

## What's SOUND (keep)
Loop body — read source with the same byte offset `ofs` as the destination,
split-init the `i12` stride:
```c
ofs = 0;
do {
    t = *(s32 *)((u8 *)arg0 + ofs);       *(s32 *)((u8 *)&D_800F1198 + ofs) = t;
    t = *(s32 *)((u8 *)arg0 + ofs + 4);   i = i + 1;  *(s32 *)((u8 *)&D_800F119C + ofs) = t;
    t = *(s32 *)((u8 *)arg0 + ofs + 8);   *(s32 *)((u8 *)&D_800F11A0 + ofs) = t;
    ofs = ofs + 12;
    t = *(s32 *)((u8 *)arg0 + ofs);
} while ((t & 1) != 0);
```
Pure C, no pins, no rules. (`i12 = i+i; i12 = i12+i; i12 = i12<<2;` = i*12 is
sanctioned split-init accumulation.)

## What was REJECTED (do NOT reuse)
```c
p = (s32 *)((u8 *)&D_800F1198 + i12);
p[2] = 0;
p[1] = 0;
*(s32 *)((u8 *)&D_800F1198 + i12) = 0;     // <-- == p[0], re-spelled
```
The third store is `p[0] = 0` written as the full base-expression ONLY to force
GCC to emit a %hi/%lo split-address store (vs the full-address form used for
p[1]/p[2]). Same lvalue, two spellings, no semantic purpose -> codegen steer
(fails 6-test 1/2/3). Cheat-by-spelling, [[inline-asm-injection]]-adjacent.

## Resume
1. Apply the loop-body fix (sound).
2. Epilogue: try a CONSISTENT zero of the 3 words (`p[0]=p[1]=p[2]=0;`, or zero
   via the array base symbols in index order) and measure the honest distance.
3. If no consistent C reaches target's split/full addressing-mode mix, this is a
   genuine addressing-mode plateau — document it; do NOT re-introduce the steer.

Cheat reference (diff only): `git show dfb9e9ac` on branch work/orch3a.
