# func_80057CC8 — WIP checkpoint (BLOCKED — continue search; not permanently parked)

## TL;DR (2026-06-22, post-adjudication)
Masked floor **9 -> 3** by reassociating both p-pointer adds from
`(table + offset)` to `(offset + table)` — pure C, no cheat. That is the
cleanest progress. The remaining 3-insn gap is a register-COALESCING decision
the masked sandbox cannot drive below 3, and the function additionally needs
its `asm("s3")` pin and all 7 regfix-subst rules to drop for COMPLETED-C.

**2026-06-22 ruling:** the split-init-off-accumulation form
(`off = (...); off += (s32)table;`) was proposed as a broad-family sanction
and **REJECTED** by user decision after layer-2 cheat-reviewer FAILed the
supporting SOTN-evidence base. Do NOT re-attempt that form. Card moves to
**blocked** (no-quit grind continues); not permanently parked.

## Resume steps
1. Apply `candidate.c` to `src/text1b.c` (replaces func_80057CC8, ~line 11840).
2. Confirm floor: `& tools/wteng.ps1 <id> sandbox func_80057CC8 --disable all` -> 3.
3. Iterate on the coalescing gap from THERE — see "Avenues still open" below.
4. Do NOT re-derive any of the rejected forms (see meta.json:rejected_forms).

## The remaining gap (the 3)
Target first `p`:  `addu v0,v0,a2` (offset+table, dest = the offset reg v0),
then `lh a0,0(v0)` / `lh a1,2(v0)`.
Ours:              `addu v1,v0,a2` (allocates a NEW reg v1), `lh ...0(v1)` etc.
=> GCC does not coalesce the offset temp into the pointer dest for the FIRST p.
The SECOND p coalesces correctly (v1->v1). The only structural asymmetry is
the `if ((s16)prev_idx < 0) { prev_idx = arg0[3]-1; }` reload: prev_idx has a
two-def (phi) live range, next_idx (set in a block) has a single def.

Also masked-out but real for the full SHA1: target holds prev_idx in `a0` and
table in `a2`; ours has them swapped. And `next_idx` must land in `s3`
naturally (the pin currently forces it).

## Ruled out (rejected_forms in meta.json — do not re-derive)
- explicit `s32 off`/`sidx` local reused for both p adds — floor 4
- ternary / single-def prev_idx with explicit sidx local — floor 5
- pointer arithmetic `table + (sidx<<1)` — floor 9
- prev_idx declared `s32` with `(u16)` casts — floor 8
- HEAD form (second p un-reassociated) — floor 9
- **`off = X; off += (s32)table;` split-init-accumulation — REJECTED**
  (rejected/split-init-off-accumulation.c). Was proposed for a broad-family
  sanction 2026-06-22; layer-2 cheat-reviewer FAILed the supporting SOTN
  evidence (mischaracterizations of e_coffin.c, dra/6BF64.c, e_bone_ark.c,
  sp20 — see meta.json:reviewer.evidence). User decision: NOT sanctioned;
  the EXACT form was already rejected by layer-1 on 2026-06-16, and
  retroactive sanction would be the self-sanctioning antipattern that
  [[review-discipline-before-commit]] was codified to prevent.

## Avenues still open (next session)
- `-da` / ALLOCDBG dump from the candidate-floor-3 baseline to see WHY the
  first p's offset temp is not coalesced into the pointer dest while the
  second's is. The two-def vs single-def live-range asymmetry is the
  prime suspect.
- Force prev_idx to a single def so its live range matches next_idx's
  shape — without contriving named-intermediate aliases. Look at branchless
  forms: `prev_idx = ((s16)tmp < 0) ? arg0[3] - 1 : tmp;` and the family of
  conditional-init shapes; verify these don't trigger the cheat-by-spelling
  catalog (e.g. ternary that compiles to a cmov sequence is OK; ternary that
  forces an unused-arm computation may not be).
- Targeted permuter run from candidate.c base (CAVEAT: text1b.c is the
  highest-cascade file; ~50% apply-failure rate per
  docs/PERMUTER_PIPELINE.md and permuter-closability-evaluated memory).
- Investigate whether one of the COMPLETED-C sibling functions in the same
  text1b cluster (`func_8006133C`, `func_800613C8`, `func_80061454`,
  `func_800614E0` — pointer-walk + mask-last family) carries a structural
  asymmetry-fix lever that could transfer to this function's prev_idx case.

## Why blocked (not matched, not park)
COMPLETED-C needs 0 rules + 0 pins + SHA1==oracle. The 7 regfix-subst rules
rename exactly the registers this gap is about (a0<->a2, dest v0<->v1) and
the s3 pin forces next_idx; the explored pure-C forms do not make GCC
produce that allocation. Genuine register-allocation plateau. Not a
canonical-asm candidate (no hand-coded signals); not a sanctioned
pure-C-impossible plateau (the gap is RA-coalescing, which is
pure-C-reachable in principle — we just haven't found the lever).

Per user 2026-06-22: keep working it; not permanently parked.
